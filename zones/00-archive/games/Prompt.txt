Write Javascript code to count Poker No Limit Texas Hold'em "outs".
The cards are in the string array arrCards.
Each card consist of two characters: Rank and Suite.
Rank = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A; Suit = S, H, C, D
The first and the second cards in arrCards are the Hole cards.
The third, fourth and fifth cards are the Flop cards.
The sixth card is the Turn card.

Check the arrCards for the potential "outs" according to the list:

One Pair to Set
One Overcard to Pair
Inside Straight Draw
Two Pair to Full House
One Pair to Two Pair
No Pair to Pair
Set to Full House
Trips to Full House
Two Overcards to Over Pair
Set to Full House
Set to Full Quads
Set to Four of a Kind
Open-Ended Straight Draw
Flush Draw
Inside Straight Draw & Two Overcards
Inside Straight Draw & Flush
Open Straight Draw & Flush Draw

Write script in linear way - no functions.
Do not use fairly new and obscure Javascript features.
Use "let" or "const" for defining variables, do not use "var".
Variables names are three first characters of the variable's type - lowercased.
Plus the descriptive name of the variable - the first character uppercased.
For the curly braces use Allman Style (BSD Style).

Place your code in this function:

function fncCountOuts()
{
  console.clear()

// Your FULL code goes here.
}



There must be two blocks of code:
The 1st block checks only from arrCards[0] to arrCards[4] - that's after Flop.
The 2nd block checks from arrCards[0] to arrCards[5] - that's after Turn.

Eliminate double count of outs.

The result of findings must be output using console.log(strOutsName + " - " + numOutsCount).
Cycle through Outs Names (see above) and output the result.
If there's no Outs of a Name output console.log(strOutsName + " - 0").

Please output the FULL code. With ALL logic.
