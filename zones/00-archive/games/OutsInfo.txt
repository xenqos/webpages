| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set to Four of a Kind           | 1 out, but part of “Set to Full House”                          |
| Inside Straight & Two Overcards | Adds up to 10 outs                                              |
| Combo Draws                     | Outs must be adjusted to avoid **double-counting** shared cards |

Missing or Optional Additions (if you want exhaustive):
| Additional Draw                           | Outs                                        | Notes |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Backdoor Flush Draw                       | 1% chance (\~1 out); needs two runner cards |       |
| Backdoor Straight Draw                    | Same as above; rare                         |       |
| Overpair to Set                           | 2 outs                                      |       |
| Trips to Full House                       | Similar to Set                              |       |
| Overcard hitting Top Pair vs. Lower Pairs | 3 outs, context-based                       |       |


Final Answer

Your list is very solid and covers nearly all key draw types post-flop. If you're aiming for an exhaustive list, consider adding:

Backdoor draws (flush/straight)

Clarify overlaps, like:

"Set to Full House" includes "Set to Quads"

"One Pair to Two Pair or Set" may double-count "Pair to Set"

Separate combo draws with logic to avoid double-counting outs
