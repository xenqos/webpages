<h2>Bitcoin Core</h2>
<p>The best way to <em>truly</em> get started with Bitcoin is to download Bitcoin Core.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.download-bitcoin-core.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.download-bitcoin-core.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Bitcoin Core is the original program created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.</p>


<p>When you run the program, it will connect to other people running the same program, creating a network of computers that communicate with each other.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.bitcoin-network.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.bitcoin-network.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Computers on the network are called <em>nodes</em>.</p>


<p>The first time you run Bitcoin Core, you will start <em>downloading a file</em> from the other nodes on the network. This file is called the <strong>blockchain</strong>, and it is one big <strong>file of transactions</strong>.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.download-blockchain.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.download-blockchain.gif'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The file is made up of individual blocks, and each block contains transactions.</p>


<p>Once you have downloaded and verified the full blockchain (currently 436.37 GB), you can start making your own transactions, which propagate the network and are written to the blockchain on everyone’s computer.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.transaction-network.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.transaction-network.gif'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The blockchain is permanent storage for transactions.</p>


<p>And that’s the basics of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Wallets</h2>
<p>The requirement of running Bitcoin Core is that you need to <strong>download and store the full blockchain</strong>. This is a <em>good thing</em>, because it creates an extra copy of the blockchain, and you’re helping to relay transactions to other computers too.</p>
<p>However, not everyone has the hard drive space to store their own copy of the blockchain.</p>
<p>So instead of running Bitcoin Core, you can use something called a
bitcoin “wallet” instead. Wallets allow you to send and receive
bitcoins, but <em>without</em> needing your own copy of the blockchain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.bitcoin-wallet.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.bitcoin-wallet.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Wallets interact with nodes.</p>


<p>If you’d prefer not to run a full node, a bitcoin wallet is the <em>easiest</em> way to get started with bitcoin.</p>
<h3>What’s the downside of using a wallet instead of Bitcoin Core?</h3>


<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/03.node-wallet-trust.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.node-wallet-trust.png'></a><br><br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin Core</strong> - You have a copy of every transaction
 ever made. Therefore you can verify every transaction you receive and
view them on your own computer, without the need to trust anyone else.</li>
<li><strong>Wallet</strong> - The wallet needs to <em>connect to a node</em>
 to get transaction information. You are therefore trusting the wallet
to connect to an honest node to get correct transaction details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a wallet is the most <em>convenient</em> way to use bitcoin (it’s the way I use it), but running a full node is the way to use bitcoin without having to <em>trust</em> anyone (which I also like to do).</p>
<p>The choice is yours.</p>


<h3>Which bitcoin wallet should I use?</h3>
<p>Bitcoin is an open-source program, so anyone can create their own
wallet. Here are the ones that I would recommend to get started with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desktop:</strong> Electrum</li>
<li><strong>Android:</strong> Samourai</li>
<li><strong>iOS:</strong> Green or Mycelium</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I say, anyone can create a bitcoin wallet, so make sure the one you use is reliable (and not just the best looking).</p>
<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> If you don’t know or trust the people who made the wallet, you can’t trust that your bitcoins will be kept safe.
</p>
<h3>What does a wallet do?</h3>
<p>When you first start using a bitcoin wallet it will give you a <strong>seed</strong>. This seed is a <em>randomly generated list of 12-24 words</em> that nobody else in the world has ever seen.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.wallet-seed.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.wallet-seed.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Honestly, nobody has seen your seed before.</p>


<p>Your seed is unique, and it is used to create every <strong>address</strong> in your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>address</strong> is what you give to people so that you can receive bitcoins.</li>
<li>Each address has it’s own <strong>private key</strong>, which is used when you send your bitcoins to someone else.</li>
</ul>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.wallet-seed-addresses.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.wallet-seed-addresses.gif'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>You could think of addresses as your <em>account numbers</em>, and the private keys as the <em>passwords</em> for them.</p>


<p>So in short, <strong>a bitcoin wallet manages your keys and addresses</strong> so that you can send and receive bitcoins.</p>
<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> If you lose your wallet, you can recover all your keys (and all your bitcoins) with just your seed.
</p>
<p class="note warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Keep your seed secure, and do not show it to anyone. If someone gets your seed they can access your bitcoins.
</p>
<h2>How does bitcoin work?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is a network of computers, and they all work together to share a file called the blockchain.</p>
<p>You can think of the blockchain as being a giant room of <em>safety deposit boxes</em>, where each of these boxes contains an <em>amount of bitcoins</em> and a <em>lock</em> on it.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.blockchain-deposit-boxes.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.blockchain-deposit-boxes.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The boxes are called <em>outputs</em>. They can contain any amount of bitcoin, and can have a variety of locks placed on them.</p>


<p>When you make a transaction,
 your wallet selects a box of bitcoins from the blockchain that belongs
to you, and creates a new box of bitcoins for the person you want to
send bitcoins to.</p>
<p>Your wallet puts the other person’s address inside the lock on the new box, and uses the necessary private key to <em>unlock</em> the box of bitcoins that is currently locked to your address.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.transaction.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.transaction.gif'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The private keys and addresses take care of the unlocking and unlocking.</p>


<p>In other words, you’re unlocking your safety deposit box, and creating a new safety deposit box for someone else.</p>
<p>Anyway, this transaction (which is just a bunch of data) is sent in
to one of the computers on the network, where it gets relayed from
computer to computer until everyone on the network has a copy of your
transaction.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.transaction-relay.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.transaction-relay.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Node propagate messages around the network.</p>


<p>Eventually this transaction will make its way in to everyone’s blockchains.</p>
<p>This happens because one of the nodes on the network collects the latest transactions they’ve received in to a <em>block</em>, and then mines
 this block on to the blockchain (which takes energy). They then share
this mined block with the other nodes on the network, and they add it to
 their blockchain too.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/03.transaction-mined-blockchain.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/03.transaction-mined-blockchain.gif'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>A new block of transactions is mined on to the blockchain roughly every 10 minutes.</p>


<p>So at regular intervals, every node on the network will update their
blockchain with the latest transactions that have been sent in to the
network. This process repeats over and over again, so the blockchain is
constantly growing with new transactions.</p>
<p>Anyway, once a transaction makes it in to the blockchain, it cannot be removed<sup>1</sup>, which means the transaction is complete, and the bitcoins have changed hands.</p>
<p>And that’s how bitcoin works.</p>
<h2>Conclusion.</h2>
<p>If you’re curious about Bitcoin as a program and want to support the network, then download and run Bitcoin Core.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Core</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re not concerned with the efforts of
running a full node and just want to send and receive bitcoins, then
just get yourself a wallet.</p>
