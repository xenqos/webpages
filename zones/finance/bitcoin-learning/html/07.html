<h1>07.Nodes</h1>
<p class="subheading">Computers running the bitcoin program.</p>

<h2>What is a node?</h2>
<p>A node is just a <strong>computer that is running the Bitcoin program</strong>. More importantly, it is <em>connected to other computers</em> (running the same program) to create a Network.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/07.05-nodes_network.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/07.05-nodes_network.png'></a><br><br></p>
<h2>What does a node do?</h2>
<p>A node has three jobs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Follow rules</li>
<li>Share information</li>
<li>Keep a copy of confirmed transactions</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Follow rules</h3>
<p>Each node (bitcoin client) has been programmed to follow a set of
rules. By following these rules a node is able to check the transactions
 it receives and only relay them if everything is cool. If there are any
 problems, the transaction isn’t passed on.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/07.01-node_rules.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/07.01-node_rules.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Your node ain’t gonna be relaying any dodgy transactions.</p>


<p>For example, one rule is that a person must own an equal or greater
amount of bitcoins than they are trying to send. So if your node
receives a transaction where someone has tried to send more bitcoins
than they own, the transaction won’t be passed on to other nodes.</p>
<h3>2. Share information</h3>
<p>A node’s main job is to share information with other nodes, and the quintessential information a node shares is transactions.</p>
<p>Now, there are two types of transactions that nodes share:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fresh transactions – transactions that have recently entered the network.</li>
<li>Confirmed transactions – transactions that have been “confirmed” and written to a file. These are shared in <em>blocks</em> of transactions, and not individually.</li>
</ol>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/07.01-node_transaction_type_sharing.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/07.01-node_transaction_type_sharing.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>A node shares both “fresh” transactions and blocks of <em>confirmed</em> transactions.</p>


<p>Don’t worry about the difference between these two right now. It will all become clear in Mining and Blocks.</p>
<h3>3. Keep a copy of confirmed transactions</h3>
<p>As mentioned, each node also keeps blocks of <em>confirmed</em> transactions. These are held together in a file called the blockchain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/07.02-node_blockchain.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/07.02-node_blockchain.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Each node also keeps a copy of the blockchain.</p>

<p>Fresh transactions are bounced around the network until they are
etched in to the blockchain, which is a ledger of confirmed
transactions.</p>
<p>Each node has a copy of the blockchain for safe keeping, and shares it with other nodes if their copy isn’t up to date.</p>
<p class="note link">
The process of adding fresh transactions to the blockchain is called Mining.
</p>
<aside class="aside">
<p>I want to mention that each node is <em>autonomous</em>.</p>
<p>By that I mean that when you run a bitcoin client, the network
doesn’t “tell you what to do”. Instead, your bitcoin client already
knows what to do, and it <em>makes it’s own decisions</em>.</p>
<p>So the entire bitcoin network is made up of nodes <em>making their own decisions</em>, but they each make the same decisions as one another, which makes it a completely <em>decentralised</em> yet powerful network.</p>
<p class="note text">
If every other node went offline, your node would be upholding the entire bitcoin network.
</p>
</aside>
<h2>Do I have to be a node to use bitcoin?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You can send and receive bitcoins without having to be a node. You
just need to get the transaction in to the bitcoin network and you’re
good to go.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/07.03-nodes_network_insert_transaction.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/07.03-nodes_network_insert_transaction.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>If you send a message to one node about a transaction, it will eventually propagate the entire network.</p>


<p>If you’re using a web wallet for example, they will feed the transactions you make in to the network for you.</p>
