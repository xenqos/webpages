<h1>17.Public Keys</h1>
<p class="subheading">A unique number generated from your private key.</p>

<h2>What is a public key?</h2>
<p>A public key is the early form of an address.</p>
<p>And like a private key, it’s stored as a big hexadecimal value:</p>
<aside class="example">
<pre class="math"><code>public_key  = 02b4632d08485ff1df2db55b9dafd23347d1c47a457072a1e87be26896549a8737</code></pre>
</aside>
<p>Anyway, here’s the interesting part; <strong>your public key is made from your private key</strong>.</p>
<p class="note tip">
If we didn’t end up compressing this public key in to a shorter format
(called an address), this would have been the “account number” that you
would have sent bitcoins too.
</p>
<h2>How do you get a public key from a private key?</h2>
<p>You insert the private key in to a special <em>mathematical function</em>, and it gives you a public key.</p>
<h3>What is this function?</h3>
<p>It’s called <strong>elliptic curve multiplication</strong>, which
basically involves “bouncing around a graph of an elliptic curve” until
you end up at a final co-ordinate on the graph. And the numbers of this
final co-ordinate give you your public key.</p>
<p>It’ll be easier if I show you…</p>
<h3>What does an elliptic curve look like?</h3>
<p>Like this:</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/17.01-elliptic-curve.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.01-elliptic-curve.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Gorgeous.</p>


<p>Furthermore, the elliptic curve used in bitcoin comes with a specific <em>starting point</em>.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/17.01-elliptic-curve-g.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.01-elliptic-curve-g.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>And if we were to do some basic “multiplication” on this curve
(e.g.&nbsp;“multiplying” the starting point by 2), we would move around
the curve like this.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/17.01-elliptic-curve-g-multiplication.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.01-elliptic-curve-g-multiplication.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The fact that we can draw a tangent anywhere on the curve and it will intersect <em>one</em> other point on the curve is a special feature of elliptic curves.</p>


<p>And there we have it. We have just “multiplied” the starting
co-ordinate (G) by 2, and found the position of the final co-ordinate
(2G).</p>
<p>This is one round of elliptic curve multiplication.</p>
<div class="note text">
<p>I keep putting “multiplication” inside quotes because it’s not standard multiplication as you know it.</p>
<p class="note important">
If you were to multiply the co-ordinates of G by 2, it would not give you the co-ordinates of 2G (as shown on the graph).
</p>
<p>You see, the <em>geniuses</em> who found out that you can move around
 the curve in this way had to call it something, so they to decided
refer to it as “multiplication”.</p>
<p>Because, you know, mathematics can never be confusing enough.</p>
<p class="note tip">
When I say “multiplication” from now on, I mean “<em>elliptic curve</em> multiplication”.
</p></div>
<h3>How do you get a public key?</h3>
<p>In the above example we multiplied <code>G</code> by 2 to get <code>2G</code>.</p>
<p>To get a public key, we multiply G by our <strong>private key</strong>.</p>
<aside class="example">
<pre class="math"><code>private_key = ef235aacf90d9f4aadd8c92e4b2562e1d9eb97f0df9ba3b508258739cb013db2
private_key = 108165236279178312660610114131826512483935470542850824183737259708197206310322

public_key  = 108165236279178312660610114131826512483935470542850824183737259708197206310322 * G</code></pre>
</aside>
<p>Or in other words, “bounce around the elliptic curve <em><strong>private key</strong></em> number of times.”</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/17.02-public-key-multiplication.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.02-public-key-multiplication.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>You get the idea.</p>


<p>The final resting point on the elliptic curve will give you a set of co-ordinates, and these co-ordinates form your public key.</p>
<p>So if these are the co-ordinates we end up with after multiplying <code>G</code> by our <code>private key</code>:</p>
<aside class="example">
<pre class="math"><code>x = 81591541406288143274758265124625798440200740391102527151086648448953253267255
y = 64573953342291915951744135406509773051817879333910826118626860448948679381492</code></pre>
</aside>
<p>Then all we have to do is convert both to hexadecimal and smush them together…</p>
<aside class="example">
<pre class="math"><code>public_key (x) = b4632d08485ff1df2db55b9dafd23347d1c47a457072a1e87be26896549a8737
public_key (y) = 8ec38ff91d43e8c2092ebda601780485263da089465619e0358a5c1be7ac91f4

public_key (x,y) = b4632d08485ff1df2db55b9dafd23347d1c47a457072a1e87be26896549a87378ec38ff91d43e8c2092ebda601780485263da089465619e0358a5c1be7ac91f4</code></pre>
</aside>
<div class="note text">
<p>This is the <em>original</em> format of public key, which means I’ve got to put an <code>04</code> at the start. Like this:</p>
<aside class="example">
<pre class="math"><code>public_key = 04b4632d08485ff1df2db55b9dafd23347d1c47a457072a1e87be26896549a87378ec38ff91d43e8c2092ebda601780485263da089465619e0358a5c1be7ac91f4</code></pre>
</aside>
<p>To find out why this is the case, I’m afraid you’re going to have to have a read through the section about <em>compressed public keys</em>…</p>
</div>


<h3>
Compressed Public Keys
</h3>


<p>To save space, public keys (these days) only use the full <code>x</code> co-ordinate.</p>
<p>This is because the elliptic curve is an <em>equation</em> (<code>y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + 7</code>), which means that if you have the <code>x</code> co-ordinate, you can still work out the corresponding <code>y</code> co-ordinate.</p>
<p>However, due to the <code>y<sup>2</sup></code> part of the equation, the <code>y</code> could be a positive or negative number:</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/17.03-y-polarity.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.03-y-polarity.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>So the only extra information you need to find the correct y
co-ordinate is to know whether the y co-ordinate is above or below the
x-axis. And due to the way elliptic curves work:</p>
<ul>
<li>If y is even, it’s above the x-axis.</li>
<li>If y is odd, it’s below the x-axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of having to store both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as the public key, you can just store <code>x</code> and whether <strong>y</strong> is (<code>even</code> or <code>odd</code>).</p>
<p>In bitcoin, the even or odd part is shown by prepending a number to the x co-ordinate.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>even = 02</code></li>
<li><code>odd = 03</code></li>
</ul>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/17.03-y-polarity-prefix.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.03-y-polarity-prefix.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>So whereas an original public key will begin with <code>04</code>, a compressed public key will begin with either <code>02</code> or <code>03</code>:</p>
<aside class="example">
<pre class="numbers"><code>public_key            = 04b4632d08485ff1df2db55b9dafd23347d1c47a457072a1e87be26896549a87378ec38ff91d43e8c2092ebda601780485263da089465619e0358a5c1be7ac91f4
public_key_compressed = 02b4632d08485ff1df2db55b9dafd23347d1c47a457072a1e87be26896549a8737</code></pre>
Much shorter.
</aside>
<p>This seems like a lot of effort for a little less text, but because
public keys are used within transaction data, it does end up saving a
lot of space in the blockchain over time.</p>


<h2>Why do we use elliptic curve multiplication to make public keys?</h2>
<p>Because elliptic curves have two properties that are useful when it comes to creating a private/public key pair.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Elliptic curve multiplication is a “trapdoor function”</strong>.
 In other words, you can’t go backwards (i.e.&nbsp;“divide” the
co-ordinates of a public key) to find out what the private key was.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A trapdoor function is a function that is easy to compute in one
direction, yet difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding
its inverse) without special information, called the “trapdoor”.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Nonetheless, <strong>the public key is still <em>mathematically connected</em> to the private key.</strong> As a result, it’s possible to prove this connection (with a little more mathematics) without having to reveal your private key.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if I gave you my public key (or address), I can prove to you that I “own” it without having to show you my private key.</p>
<p>This ability is especially handy when I want to make a bitcoin
transaction, which involves putting my public key in to the transaction
data and proving that I’m the owner of it, without having to put my
private key in to the transaction data too.</p>
<p class="tip">
A public key is a unique number that has been created from a private
key. So when I say “prove I own” a public key, I mean “show that I know
the number of the private key that the public key was created from”.
</p>
<h3>How can you prove you own a public key?</h3>
<aside class="aside">
This is a whole topic (or two) in itself. But seeing as this is such an
annoyingly relevant question right now, I’ll try my best to cover the
basics.
</aside>
<p>As mentioned, there’s a mathematical connection between my private key and my public key.</p>
<p>As a result:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I can put my <strong>private key</strong> through some more elliptic curve mathematics to get <em><strong>a new value</strong></em>.</li>
<li>I can put my <strong>public key</strong> through some other elliptic curve mathematics to get <em><strong>another new value</strong></em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/17.04-keys-ec-math.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.04-keys-ec-math.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>Now, there will be some <em>small overlap</em> in these new values.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/17.04-keys-ec-math-verification.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/17.04-keys-ec-math-verification.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The new value I can create from my private key is called a <em>digital signature</em></p>

<p class="note important">
The overlap proves that there is a <em>mathematical connection</em> between the public and private key.
</p>
<p>And because nobody is able to recreate this digital signature without
 the private key, my digital signature it’s enough to prove that I “own”
 the public key.</p>
<p>So I can show you that I own a public key with a digital signature, and you never need to see my private key.</p>
