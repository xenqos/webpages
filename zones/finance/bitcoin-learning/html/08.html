<h1>08.Mining</h1>
<p class="subheading">The process of adding blocks to the blockchain.</p>

<h2>What is Mining?</h2>
<p>Mining is the process of adding transactions to the blockchain.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Every node on the bitcoin network shares information about new transactions. They store these transactions in their <span class="term">memory pool</span>.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.01-network-memory-pool.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.01-network-memory-pool.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The memory pool is a node’s temporary storage area for transaction data.</p>


<p>Each node also has the option to try and “mine” the transactions in their memory pool in to a <strong>file</strong>. This file is a ledger of every bitcoin transaction, and it’s called the <span class="term"><strong>blockchain</strong></span>.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.02-node-pool-block.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.02-node-pool-block.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>You could think of the memory pool as “floating” transactions and the blockchain as “archived” transactions.</p>


<p class="note important">
However, to add transactions from the memory pool to the blockchain, a node has to use a lot of computer processing power.
</p>
<p>This processing power is forced through the existence of a <em>challenge</em> in the memory pool.</p>
<h3>What is this challenge?</h3>
<p>Okay, imagine you’re a node. At any moment in time you can condense
the transactions in your memory pool in to a single “string” of numbers
and letters.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.03-node-pool-string.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.03-node-pool-string.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>This string represents all of the transactions in your memory pool.</p>


<p>Now, your objective is to <span class="term">hash</span> this string with <em>another number</em> to <strong>try and get a new string that begins with a certain number of zeros</strong>.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.04-node-pool-string-nonce.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.04-node-pool-string-nonce.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Most of the time you will get a result that isn’t even close.</p>



<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.04-node-pool-string-nonce-success.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.04-node-pool-string-nonce-success.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>But if you keep going you may stumble upon a number that works.</p>


<p>Now, this sounds easy enough, but it’s actually difficult. It’s
utterly random, and you can only hope to find a winning result through
trial and error. And that’s what Mining <em>is</em> – lots of hashing (using lots of your computer’s processing power) and hoping to get lucky.</p>
<p>But if you are lucky enough to find a successful hash result, the
transactions in your memory pool get added to the blockchain, and every
other node on the network adds your block of transactions to their
blockchain.</p>
<p>You’ll also receive a 25BTC reward for your effort, as well as
picking up any fees that were tacked on to the transactions that you
just added to the blockchain.</p>

<p class="note text">
The “certain number of zeros” comes from the difficulty.
 This is set by the network and changes based on the volume of miners –
the more people mining, the greater the difficulty and the more zeros
are needed at the start (which makes it harder to find a winning
result).
</p>
<p class="note link">
This is a slightly simplified version of how blocks are added to the blockchain. For a bit more detail, check out Blocks.
</p>
<h2>Why is Mining necessary?</h2>
<p>Good question. Why not add transactions directly to the blockchain?</p>
<p class="note important">
Because mining allows the entire Bitcoin Network to agree on which transactions get “archived”, and this is how you <strong>prevent fraud</strong> in a digital currency.
</p>
<h3>Go on…</h3>
<p>When you make a bitcoin transaction, nodes on the network do not hear
 about it instantly. Instead, transactions travel across the bitcoin
network by being passed from one node to the next.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.05-network-transaction-propagation.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.05-network-transaction-propagation.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>A fun word for describing the way transactions travel across the network is <em>propagation</em>.</p>


<p>However, it’s actually possible to make <em>another</em> transaction using those <em>same</em>
 bitcoins and insert that transaction in to the network too. For
example, you could buy a beer with some bitcoins, then quickly attempt
to buy a slice of pizza with those same bitcoins too.</p>
<p>In other words, some good ol’ <strong>fraud</strong>.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.06-network-transaction-propagation-pizza.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.06-network-transaction-propagation-pizza.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Some
 nodes would get the pizza transaction first (and ignore the beer
transaction), whereas others would get the beer transaction first (and
ignore the pizza transaction).</p>


<p>Yet even though you make the pizza transaction <em>after</em> the
beer transaction, due to the way transactions travel across the Bitcoin
Network, the network would be in a disagreement about whether you should
 get the beer or the pizza.</p>
<h3>So how does the network decide which transaction to go with?</h3>
<p>Mining, of course.</p>
<p class="note important">
If a node on the network completes the challenge, then it’s the transactions in <em>their memory pool</em> that get added to the blockchain.
</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.07-network-transaction-resolution.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.07-network-transaction-resolution.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>If
 a node with the pizza transaction successfully mines a block, then
that’s the transaction that gets added to the blockchain, and the beer
transaction evaporates from the network.</p>


It seems like a little unorthodox way to select transactions, I know,
but this is the solution the bitcoin network uses to reach a <em>consensus</em> when dealing with conflicting information.
<p></p>
<p class="note text">
On the plus side, it only takes about 10 minutes for each new block of
transactions to be added to the blockchain, so you only need to wait 10
minutes for a confirmation that bitcoins have “arrived” at a new address
 (and haven’t been sent to an alternative address).
</p>
<h3>Another benefit of Mining.</h3>
<p class="note important">
If you want to try and control the blocks (i.e.&nbsp;transactions) that
get added to the blockchain, you have to compete to solve block puzzles
with every other mining node on the bitcoin network.
</p>
<p>In other words, you need to have a computer with enough processing
power that is able to out-work the combined processing power of every
other bitcoin miner.</p>
<p>Which is entirely possible – you just need to spend a few billion on
hardware and you’re good to go (although this figure increases with
every new miner who joins the network).</p>
<h2>How do I start mining?</h2>
<p>Fancy a crack at that 25BTC reward eh?</p>
<p class="note important">
To start mining, you flick a switch in the bitcoin client.
</p>
<p>However, due to the fact that trying to mine bitcoins using the CPU
on your laptop is horribly inefficient, the “mine” switch has been taken
 out of the software interface.</p>
<p>But not worry, because the functionality is still there… you just have to enter a command instead:</p>
<aside>
<p>Go to: <code>Help &gt; Debug Window &gt; Console</code></p>
<p>And enter this command:</p>
<pre><code>setgenerate true</code></pre>
<a target='_blank' href='../images/08.setgenerate-true.jpg'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/08.setgenerate-true.jpg'></a><br><br>
</aside>
<p>This is the command to “turn mining <em>on</em>”. Your client will now <em>generate blocks (of transactions)</em> from the transactions in your memory pool and start hashing them.</p>
<p>You will know it’s working because your processor will start whizzing
 as it hashes away at the blocks it generates to try and get a result
that works.</p>
<p>It probably won’t solve a block (it would be a miracle), but it’s fun to give it a shot.</p>
<aside>
<p>To turn mining off:</p>
<pre><code>setgenerate false</code></pre>
