<h1>Negative Volume Index</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Negative Volume Index ("NVI") focuses on days where the volume decreases from the
previous day.  The premise being that the "smart money" takes positions on days when volume
decreases.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>The interpretation of the NVI assumes that on days when volume increases, the
crowd-following "uninformed" investors are in the market.  Conversely, on days with
decreased volume, the "smart money" is quietly taking positions.  Thus, the NVI displays
what the smart money is doing.</p>
<p>In Stock Market Logic, Norman Fosback points out that the odds of a bull market are 95
out of 100 when the NVI rises above its one-year moving average.  The odds of a bull market
are roughly 50/50 when the NVI is below its one-year average.  Therefore, the NVI is most
usefuly as a bull market indicator.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows Avon and its
NVI.  I drew "buy" arrows whenever the NVI crossed
above its 1-year (255-trading day) moving average.</p>

I drew "equal-signs" when the NVI fell
below the moving average.  You can see that the NVI did a great job of identifying
profitable opportunities.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>If today's volume is less than yesterday's volume then:</p>

<p>If today's volume is greater than or equal to yesterday's volume then:</p>

<p>Because falling prices are usually associated with falling volume, the  NVI usually
trends downward.</p>
