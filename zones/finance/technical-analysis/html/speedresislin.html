<h1>Speed Resistance Lines</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Speed Resistance Lines ("SRL"), sometimes called 1/3-2/3 lines, are a series of trendlines
that divide a price move into three equal sections.  They are similar in construction and
interpretation to Fibonacci Fan Lines.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Speed Resistance Lines display three trendlines.  The slope of each line defines a
different rate at which pricing expectations are changing.</p>
<p>Prices should find support above the 2/3 line.  When prices do fall below the 2/3 line,
they should quickly drop to the 1/3 line where they should then again find support.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

The following charts show McDonald's price and Speed Resistance Lines.</p>
<img src="../images/speedresistancelines-1.webp"></p>
<img src="../images/speedresistancelines-2.webp"></p>

<p>The initial trendline was drawn from the low point
labeled "A" to the high point labeled "B."  You can see that prices found support each time
they fell to the 2/3 line.  When prices finally penetrated the 2/3 line (at point "C") they
quickly fell to the 1/3 line where they again found support.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

To draw Speed Resistance Lines:</p></p>
<OL>
<li>Draw a line from a major low to a major high.</li>
<li>Draw a vertical line on the day the major high occurred.  Divide this vertical line
into thirds.</li>
<li>Draw lines from the major low so they intersect the vertical line at the 1/3 and 2/3
levels.</li>
</ol>
