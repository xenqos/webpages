<h1>William's Accumulation/Distribution</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Accumulation is a term used to describe a market controlled by buyers; whereas distribution
is defined by a market controlled by sellers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Williams recommends trading this indicator based on
divergences:</p>
<UL>
<li>Distribution of the security is indicated when the security is making a new high and
the A/D indicator is failing to make a new high.  Sell.</li>

<li>Accumulation of the security is indicated when the security is making a new low and
the A/D indicator is failing to make a new low.  Buy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows
Proctor and Gamble and the Williams' Accumulation/Distribution indicator.</p>

<p>A bearish
divergence occurred when the prices were making a new high (point "A2") and the A/D
indicator was failing to make a new high (point "A1").  This was the time to sell.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>To calculate Williams' Accumulation/Distribution indicator, first determine the True Range
High ("TRH") and True Range Low ("TRL").</p>
<P><img src="../images/williamsaccumdistrcalc1.webp"></p>
<p>Today's accumulation/distribution is then determined by comparing today's closing price
to yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>If today's close is greater than yesterday's close:</p>

<p>If today's close is less than yesterday's close:</p>
<P><img src="../images/williamsaccumdistrcalc3.webp"></p>
<p>If today's close is equal to yesterday's close:</p>

<p>The Williams' Accumulation/Distribution indicator is a cummulative total of these daily
values.</p>
