<h1>Price Rate-Of-Change</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Price Rate-of-Change ("ROC") indicator displays the difference between the current
price and the price x-time periods ago.  The difference can be displayed in either points
or as a percentage.  The Momentum indicator displays the same
information, but expresses it as a ratio.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>It is a well recognized phenomenon that security prices surge ahead and retract in a
cyclical wave-like motion.  This cyclical action is the result of the changing expectations
as bulls and bears struggle to control prices.</p>
<p>The ROC displays the wave-like motion in an oscillator format by measuring the amount
that prices have changed over a given time period.  As prices increase, the ROC rises; as
prices fall, the ROC falls.  The greater the change in prices, the greater the change in
the ROC.</p>
<p>The time period used to calculate the ROC may range from 1-day (which results in a
volatile chart showing the daily price change) to 200-days (or longer).  The most popular
time periods are the 12- and 25-day ROC for short to intermediate-term trading.  These time
periods were popularized by Gerald Appel and Fred Hitschler in their book,
Stock Market Trading Systems.</p>
<p>The 12-day ROC is an excellent short- to intermediate-term overbought/oversold
indicator.  The higher the ROC, the more overbought the security; the lower the ROC, the
more likely a rally.  However, as with all overbought/over-sold indicators, it is prudent
to wait for the market to begin to correct (i.e., turn up or down) before placing your
trade.  A market that appears overbought may remain overbought for some time.  In fact,
extremely overbought/oversold readings usually imply a continuation of the current
trend.</p>
<p>The 12-day ROC tends to be very cyclical, oscillating back and forth in a fairly regular
cycle.  Often, price changes can be anticipated by studying the previous cycles of the ROC
and relating the previous cycles to the current market.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows the 12-day ROC
of Walgreen expressed in percent.</p>
<img src="../images/pricerate-of-change-1.webp"></p>

I drew "buy" arrows each time the ROC fell below, and
then rose above, the oversold level of -6.5.  I drew "sell" arrows each time the ROC rose
above, and then fell below, the overbought level of +6.5.</p>
<p>The optimum overbought/oversold levels (e.g., ±6.5) vary depending on the security being
analyzed and overall market conditions.  I selected ±6.5 by drawing a horizontal line on
the chart that isolated previous "extreme" levels of Walgreen's 12-day ROC.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>When the Rate-of-Change displays the price change in points, it subtracts the price x-time
periods ago from today's price:</p>

<p>When the Rate-of-Change displays the price change as a percentage, it divides the price
change by price x-time period's ago:</p>
