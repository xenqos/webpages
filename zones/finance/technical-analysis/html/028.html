<h1>CANSLIM</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>CANSLIM is an acronym for a stock market investment method developed by William O'Neil.
O'Neil is the founder and chairman of <i>Investor's Business Daily</i>, a national business
newspaper.  He also heads an investment research organization, William O'Neil & Company,
Inc.</p>
<p>Drawing from his study of the greatest money-making stocks from 1953 to 1985, O'Neil
developed a set of common characteristics that each of these stocks possessed.  The key
characteristics to focus on are captured in the acronym CANSLIM.</p>

<p>Although not strictly a technical analysis tool, the CANSLIM approach combines worthy
technical and fundamental concepts.  The CANSLIM approach is covered in detail in O'Neil's
book, How To Make Money In Stocks.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The following text summarizes each of the seven components of the CANSLIM method.</p>

<h2>Current Quarterly Earnings</h2>

<p>Earnings per share ("EPS") for the most recent quarter should be up at least 20% when
compared to the same quarter for the previous year (e.g., first quarter of 1993 to the
first quarter of 1994).</p>

<h2>Annual Earnings Growth</h2>

<p>Earnings per share over the last five years should be increasing at the rate of at least
15% per year.  Preferably, the EPS should increase each year.  However, a single year
set-back is acceptable if the EPS quickly recovers and moves back into new high
territory.</p>

<h2>New Products, New Management, New Highs</h2>

<p>A dramatic increase in a stock's price typically coincides with something "new."  This
could be a new product or service, a new CEO, a new technology, or even new high stock
prices.</p>
<p>One of O'Neil's most surprising conclusions from his research is contrary to what many
investors feel to be prudent.  Instead of adhering to the old stock market maxim, "buy low
and sell high," O'Neil would say, "buy high and sell higher."  O'Neil's research concluded
that the ideal time to purchase a stock is when it breaks into new high territory after
going through a two to 15 month consolidation period.  Some of the most dramatic increases
follow such a breakout, due possibly to the lack of resistance (i.e., sellers).</p>

<h2>Shares Outstanding</h2>

<p>More than 95% of the stocks in O'Neil's study of the greatest stock market winners had less
than 25 million shares outstanding.  Using the simple principles of
supply and demand, restricting the shares
outstanding forces the supply line to shift upward which results in higher prices.</p>
<p>A huge amount of buying (i.e., demand) is required to move a stock with 400 million
shares outstanding.  However, only a moderate amount of buying is required to propel a
stock with only four to five million shares outstanding (particularly if a large amount is
held by corporate insiders).</p>

<h2>Leader</h2>

<p>Although there is never a "satisfaction guaranteed" label attached to a stock, O'Neil found
that you could significantly increase your chances of a profitable investment if you
purchase a leading stock in a leading industry.</p>
<p>He also found that winning stocks are usually outperforming the majority of stocks in
the overall market as well.</p>

<h2>Institutional Sponsorship</h2>

<p>The biggest source of supply and demand comes from institutional buyers (e.g., mutual
funds, banks, insurance companies, etc).  A stock does not require a large number of
institutional sponsors, but institutional sponsors certainly give the stock a vote of
approval.  As a rule of thumb, O'Neil looks for stocks that have at least 3 to 10
institutional sponsors with better-than-average performance records.</p>
<p>However, too much sponsorship can be harmful.  Once a stock has become
"institutionalized" it may be too late.  If 70 to 80 percent of a stock's outstanding
shares are owned by institutions, the well may have run dry. The result of excessive
institutional ownership can translate into excessive selling if bad news strikes.</p>
<p>O'Neil feels the ideal time to purchase a stock is when it has just become discovered by
several quality institutional sponsors, but before it becomes so popular that it appears on
every institution's hot list.</p>

<h2>Market Direction</h2>

<p>This is the most important element in the formula.  Even the best stocks can lose money if
the general market goes into a slump.  Approximately seventy-five percent of all stocks
move with the general market.  This means that you can pick stocks that meet all the other
criteria perfectly, yet if you fail to determine the direction of the general market, your
stocks will probably perform poorly.</p>
<p>Market indicators are designed to help
you determine the conditions of the overall market.  O'Neil says, "Learn to interpret a
daily price and volume chart of the market averages.  If you do, you can't get too far off
the track.  You really won't need much else unless you want to argue with the trend of the
market."</font></p>
