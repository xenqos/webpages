<h1>Andrew's Pitchfork</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Andrews' Pitchfork is a line study consisting of three parallel trendlines based on three
points you select.  This tool was developed by Dr. Alan Andrews.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>The interpretation of a pitchfork is based on normal trendline
support and resistance principles.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart of Xerox shows an
Andrews' Pitchfork.</p>
<img src="../images/andrewspitchfork-1.webp"></p>

<p>The pitchfork was displayed by selecting the three points shown.  You
can see how prices tended to "walk along" the trendlines.</p>


<h2>Caculation</h2>

<p>The first trendline begins at the left-most point selected (either a major peak or trough)
and is drawn so it passes directly between the two right-most points.  This line is the
"handle" of the pitchfork.  The second and third trendlines are then drawn beginning at the
two right-most points (a major peak and a major trough) and are drawn parallel to the first
line.  These lines are the "tines" of the pitchfork.</p>
