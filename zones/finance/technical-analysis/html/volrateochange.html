<h1>Volume Rate-Of-Change</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Volume Rate-of-Change ("ROC") is calculated identically to the
Price ROC, except it displays the ROC of the security's
volume, rather than of its closing price.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Almost every significant chart formation (e.g., tops, bottoms, breakouts, etc) is
accompanied by a sharp increase in volume.  The Volume ROC shows the speed at which volume
is changing.</p>
<p>Additional information on the interpretation of volume trends can be found in the
discussions on Volume and on the
Volume Oscillator.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following chart shows Texas
Instruments and its 12-day Volume ROC.</p>

When prices broke out of the triangular pattern,
they were accompanied by a sharp increase in volume.  The increase in volume confirmed the
validity of the price breakout.</p>


<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The Volume Rate-Of-Change indicator is calculated by dividing the amount that volume has
changed over the last n-periods by the volume n-periods ago.  The result is the percentage
that the volume has changed in the last n-periods.</p>
<p>If the volume is higher today than n-periods ago, the ROC will be a positive number.  If
the volume is lower today than n-periods ago, the ROC will be a negative number.</p>
