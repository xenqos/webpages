<h1>Efficient Market Theory</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Efficient Market Theory says that security prices correctly and almost immediately
reflect all information and expectations.  It says that you cannot consistently outperform
the stock market due to the random nature in which information arrives and the fact that
prices react and adjust almost immediately to reflect the latest information.  Therefore,
it assumes that at any given time, the market correctly prices all securities.  The result,
or so the Theory advocates, is that securities cannot be overpriced or underpriced for a
long enough period of time to profit therefrom.</p>
<p>The Theory holds that since prices reflect all available information, and since
information arrives in a random fashion, there is little to be gained by any type of
analysis, whether fundamental or technical.  It assumes that every piece of information has
been collected and processed by thousands of investors and this information (both old and
new) is correctly reflected in the price.  Returns cannot be increased by studying
historical data, either fundamental or technical, since past data will have no effect on
future prices.</p>
<p>The problem with both of these theories is that <i>many</i> investors base their expectations
on past prices (whether using technical indicators, a strong track record, an oversold
condition, industry trends, etc). And since investors expectations control prices, it seems
obvious that past prices do have a significant influence on future prices.</p>
