The Brothers Grimm famously analyzed the First Sound Shift (Grimm's Law), which set all Germanic languages apart from the rest of Indo-European.

The High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift) happened centuries later and is the direct reason why German consonants like pf, z, ch, and t often correspond to English p, t, k, and d/th in cognate words. This shift defines the difference between High German and its linguistic relatives like English.

Proto-Germanic / English / Low German	High German Result	English Example (cognate)	German Example	Shift Type
p →	pf (initially) or ff (medially)	pound, apple, shop	Pfund, Apfel, Schoff	p → pf / ff
	f (finally/other)	sl eep, sharp	schlafen, scharf
t →	ts (written z) (initially) or ss (medially)	time, out, water, ten	Zeit, ausser, Wasser, zehn	t → ts/z / ss
	s (finally/other)	that, it	das, es
k →	kch (written ch)	key, make, break	Cheis (dial.), machen, brechen	k → kch/ch
d →	t	day, dander, dodge	Tag, Haut, (ver)decken*	d → t
θ (th) →	d	thank, thing, thorn	danken, Ding, Dorn	θ (th) → d




Consonant in English Cognate	Typical German Equivalent	Pattern & Example
p	pf, ff, or f	Pipe → Pfeife, pound → Pfund, shape → schaffen

k	ch (after i, e, ä, ö; else k)	make → machen, break → brechen, book → Buch
d	t	dark → dunkel (no shift), do → tun (shifted), day → Tag
th (voiceless /θ/)	d	thank → danken, thin → dünn
v / f (from older p)	b or f/v (different history)	have / give → haben / geben (not a shift, but a key difference)
s (often)	s (but pronounced /z/ in English)	sun → Sonne, grass → Gras (spelling reflects older 'ss')
b	b (mostly unchanged)	book → Buch, bite → beißen











1. Voiceless Stops Shifting to Affricates (Word-Initial, After Consonants, or Geminated)

p → pf
English retains /p/; German shifts to /pf/.
Examples: English "pipe" → German "Pfeife"; English "pound" → German "Pfund"; English "apple" → German "Apfel" (geminated pp → pf).
t → ts (often spelled z or tz)
English retains /t/; German shifts to /ts/.
Examples: English "water" → German "Wasser" (post-vocalic t → ss, but initial t → z).
k → kx (often spelled ch, pronounced /x/ or /ç/)
English retains /k/; German shifts to /kx/ or /x/.
Examples: English "kin" → German "Kind" (minimal shift here, but see others); English "make" → German "machen"; English "book" → German "Buch".

2. Voiceless Stops Shifting to Fricatives (Post-Vocalic Position)

p → f
English retains /p/; German shifts to /f/.
Examples: English "ship" → German "Schiff"; English "open" → German "offen".
t → s (often spelled s or ss)
English retains /t/; German shifts to /s/.
Examples: English "foot" → German "Fuß"; English "heart" → German "Herz".
k → x (spelled ch)
English retains /k/; German shifts to /x/.
Examples: English "break" → German "brechen"; English "speak" → German "sprechen".

3. Voiced Stops Shifting to Voiceless Stops (Devoicing, More Pronounced in Southern German)

b → p
English retains /b/; German shifts to /p/.
Examples: English "bishop" → German "Bischof" (minimal), but see English "rib" → German "Rippe".
d → t
English retains /d/; German shifts to /t/.
Examples: English "day" → German "Tag"; English "good" → German "gut".
g → k
English retains /g/; German shifts to /k/.
Examples: English "goose" → German "Gans" (related); English "give" → German "geben" (minimal), but English "guest" → German "Gast" (g remains, but see shifts like English "ridge" → German "Rücken").
