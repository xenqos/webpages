<a name='name.089'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Backdoor</h2>
<p>A backdoor in poker is a term that refers to a situation where a player needs two consecutive cards on the turn and river to complete a hand. This is often used to describe situations where a player has a small chance of completing a hand but ends up doing so by getting the right cards on the turn and river.</p>
<h3>The Concept of Backdoor in Poker</h3>
<p>A backdoor draw is a poker term that describes a situation where a player needs both the turn and river cards to complete a winning hand. It&#039;s not the ideal situation to be in, as the odds of completing a backdoor draw are usually quite low. However, when it does happen, it can result in a strong hand that can take down the pot.</p>
<p>Backdoor draws are most common in Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, where there are multiple community cards dealt throughout the hand. This gives players multiple opportunities to complete a backdoor draw.</p>
<h3>The Strategy Behind Backdoor</h3>
<p>Although a backdoor draw is not a strong hand to start with, it can sometimes be a good idea to stay in the hand if the pot odds are right. For example, if there are a lot of players in the pot and it&#039;s not too expensive to call, it might be worth it to see if you can hit your backdoor draw.</p>
<p>However, a key point to remember is that backdoor draws should not be the main part of your poker strategy. They are more of a plan B, in case your original plan doesn&#039;t work out. Relying on backdoor draws too often can lead to losing chips quickly.</p>
<h3>Examples of &#039;Backdoor&#039; in Poker</h3>
<p>For example, let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt an Ace of Hearts and King of Hearts. The flop comes down 2 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, and Jack of Spades. At this point, you have a backdoor flush draw, meaning if the turn and river are both Hearts, you would have a flush.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I was dealt a pair of Kings and the flop was all low cards, but I still had a backdoor flush draw.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Even though my hand wasn&#039;t strong, I decided to call because I had a backdoor straight draw.&quot;</li><li>&quot;I was lucky and hit my backdoor flush on the river to win the hand.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.090'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Backdoor Flush</h2>
<p>In hold'em or Omaha, a flush that is completed using <i>both</i> the turn and river cards. For example, if a player has <q class='h'>A</q><q class='h'>8</q> and the flop only brings one heart, that player needs both the turn and river to bring hearts in order to complete a &quot;backdoor flush.&quot; See also &quot;Runner-Runner.&quot;</p>

For example, if a player has <q class='c'>T</q><q class='h'>8</q> and the flop comes <q class='c'>A</q><q class='c'>K</q><q class='s'>9</q>, then the river is the <q class='s'>6</q> and river the <q class='h'>7</q> to complete a <i>backdoor straight.</i> See also &quot;Runner-Runner.&quot;</p>

<a name='name.093'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Backraise</h2>
<p>A &#039;Backraise&#039; in poker refers to a re-raise from a player who originally called a bet. This is a powerful move used to trap aggressive players or to build the pot when a player has a strong hand.</p>
<h3>What is a Backraise in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Backraise&#039; is a strategic move that involves a player first calling a bet and then re-raising when the action returns to them in the same betting round. This move can be used as a trapping play against aggressive opponents or as a way to build a larger pot when a player has a strong hand.</p>
<h3>The Strategy of Backraising </h3>
<p>Backraising can be a highly effective tactic when used in the right situations. It often comes as a surprise to opponents, which can cause them to make mistakes in their response.</p>
<p>Backraising is typically used in two main scenarios. The first is as a trapping play against aggressive opponents. By initially just calling, a player with a strong hand can induce further bets from aggressive opponents. When the action returns to them, they then re-raise, forcing their opponents to commit more money to the pot.</p>
<p>The second scenario is when a player wants to build a larger pot. By backraising, they can potentially get more money into the pot than they could by simply raising in the first place.</p>
<h3>When to Backraise </h3>
<p>Deciding when to backraise should be based on the specific circumstances of the hand. Here are a few situations when a backraise might be a good move:<br/>
You have a strong hand and you&#039;re facing an aggressive opponent who is likely to bet or raise.<br/>
You&#039;re in a late position and several players have already called the initial bet.<br/>
You have a strong hand and you want to build the pot.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Backraise&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a pair of aces. An aggressive player raises before the flop, and you decide to just call, hoping to induce further bets. Another player then also raises. When the action returns to you, you backraise, forcing your opponents to commit more money to the pot.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With a pair of aces in hand, he decided to backraise to trap the aggressive player.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She used a backraise to build a larger pot after hitting a set on the flop.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Facing multiple opponents who had already called, he decided to backraise with his strong hand.&quot;</li></ul>
<h3>Backraise in Poker FAQs </h3>
<p>[FAQ]<br/>
Q: What is a backraise in poker?<br/>
A: A backraise in poker is a strategic move that involves a player first calling a bet and then re-raising when the action returns to them in the same betting round.</p>
<p>Q: When should I backraise?<br/>
A: You should consider a backraise when you have a strong hand and you&#039;re facing an aggressive opponent who is likely to bet or raise, or when you want to build a larger pot.</p>
<p>Q: Is a backraise a form of bluffing?<br/>
A: While a backraise can be used as a bluffing strategy, it&#039;s typically used when a player has a strong hand and wants to induce further bets or build a larger pot.</p>
<p>Q: Can I backraise in any poker variant?<br/>
A: Yes, the concept of backraising can be applied in any poker variant where there are multiple betting rounds and raises are allowed.</p>

<a name='name.094'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bad Beat</h2>
<p>A bad beat in poker refers to a situation where a player with what appears to be strong cards nevertheless loses. It often occurs when a player bets the stronger hand and their opponent makes a poor call that eventually wins with the turn or the river card.</p>
<h3>Understanding Bad Beat</h3>
<p>A <b>bad beat</b> can be a pivotal moment in a poker game. It&#039;s a term used to describe a highly favored hand losing to an underdog&#039;s hand that catches up and beats it. In essence, it&#039;s when a player loses a hand despite having the odds significantly in their favor.</p>
<p>The most common scenario is when a player goes all-in with a strong hand like aces or kings and gets called by a player with a lesser hand like 5-6 suited. The flop, turn, and river come out in a way that favors the lesser hand, resulting in a <b>bad beat</b>.</p>
<p>Bad beats are a part of the game, and handling them with grace is a part of being a good poker player.</p>
<h3>Bad Beat in Online Poker and Live Poker</h3>
<p>Whether you&#039;re playing <b>poker online</b> or live, bad beats are inevitable. Online, they might seem more frequent due to the speed of play. In live poker, bad beats can be more dramatic as players physically react to the loss.</p>
<p>Bad beat jackpots are popular in both online and <b>live poker</b>. They offer a consolation prize to the player who loses with a strong hand, often quad eights or better.</p>

<p>Examples of bad beat situations include:<br/>
You have a pair of aces, and your opponent has a pair of eights. The community cards come out, and your opponent ends up with four eights.<br/>
You have a straight, and your opponent has a lower straight. The river card gives your opponent a flush.</p>
<p>Example sentences of the term in use:</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I had pocket aces and still lost. Talk about a bad beat.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He caught his only out on the river for a bad beat.&quot;</li><li>&quot;I&#039;ve had some bad beats, but losing with a full house was the worst.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.095'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bad Beat Jackpot</h2>
<p>A bad beat jackpot is offered by a poker room when a very good hand loses to an even better one. </p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p>For example:</p>
<p>Player 1 holds AA<br/>
Player 2 holds KK</p>
<p>The community cards are: AAKKQ</p>
<p>Player 2 would have four of a kind, Kings but still lose to Player 1 who holds four of a kind, Aces.</p>
<p>This is usually enough to trigger a bad beat jackpot for the hand.  Normally the losing player in this hand would be awarded 50% of the jackpot fund, the winner gets 25% and other players who took part in the hand get the remaining 25%.  Different poker rooms offer different levels of payouts for bad beat jackpots and have different losing hand requirements, for example, Party Poker bad beat jackpot winners must lose with a hand of four 8s or better to qualify.</p></div>

<a name='name.096'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Balanced Style</h2>
<p>A style of play that avoids potentially exploitable patterns by performing different actions in similar situations. For example, a player who always makes a pot-sized bet with a strong hand becomes very predictable to attentive opponents, but by “balancing” his style with a variety of actions in the same situation (e.g., checking, betting small, betting half the pot, betting the whole pot), the player becomes more difficult to read.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.097'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bankroll</h2>
<p>A &#039;<b>Bankroll</b>&#039; in poker refers to the total amount of money a player has set aside to play poker. It&#039;s an essential part of poker strategy, as it determines the stakes a player can afford to play and helps manage the inherent variance in poker.</p>
<h3>What is a Bankroll in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;<b>bankroll</b>&#039; is the total sum of money a player dedicates to playing poker. It&#039;s a separate fund from personal finances and is used solely for poker-related expenses. The size of a player&#039;s bankroll can influence their betting decisions, the stakes they play, and how they manage their money.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Bankroll Management </h3>
<p>Proper bankroll management is a crucial aspect of successful poker play. It&#039;s a risk management strategy designed to ensure that a player can withstand the natural swings and variance associated with poker without going broke.</p>
<p>Bankroll management involves playing within your limits and not risking more than a small percentage of your bankroll on any single game or tournament. This approach helps players stay in the game longer and ride out losing streaks.</p>
<h3>Determining Your Bankroll </h3>
<p>How much money you should have in your poker bankroll depends on several factors, including the type of poker you&#039;re playing (<b>cash games</b> vs. <b>tournaments</b>), your skill level, and your tolerance for risk. As a general rule, you should have enough in your bankroll to cover a reasonable number of buy-ins.</p>
<p>For example, if you&#039;re a cash game player, a common recommendation is to have a bankroll of at least 20-30 times the buy-in of the stakes you&#039;re playing. If you&#039;re a tournament player, you might want to have a bankroll of at least 100 times the buy-in of the tournaments you play.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Bankroll&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re a regular player at $1/$2 No-Limit Hold&#039;em cash games, where the typical buy-in is $200. Following the recommendation of having a bankroll of at least 20 times the buy-in, you should ideally have a bankroll of $4,000.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With a bankroll of $5,000, he comfortably played at the $1/$2 cash game table.&quot;</li><li>&quot;After a few losing sessions, she decided to move down in stakes to protect her bankroll.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a strong hand, he considered his bankroll before deciding to join the high-stakes game.&quot;</li></ul>

This is done usually for the purpose of stimulating action, but sometimes to discourage an opponent from raising. Sometimes players claim to bet blind but have actually seen their draw card or cards; doing this is considered bad form, and gives the claimant a bad reputation.

<a name='name.113'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bet Sizing</h2>
<p>Bet sizing in poker is the act of determining the appropriate amount to wager in a particular situation. A crucial aspect of successful poker strategy, bet sizing can influence the outcomes and profitability of your poker games.</p>
<h3>Understanding Bet Sizing </h3>
<p>Bet sizing is not a one-size-fits-all concept in poker. It depends on multiple factors such as the <b>pot size</b>, <b>opponent&#039;s tendencies</b>, <b>hand strength</b>, and <b>table dynamics</b>. By adjusting your bet size according to these variables, you can maximize your expected value (<b>EV</b>) in the long run.</p>
<p>In <b>cash games</b>, common bet sizes range from half-pot to full-pot bets, while in <b>tournament poker</b>, players often use a smaller bet size due to the increasing blinds and antes. The goal of bet sizing is to construct a bet that gives your opponents a tough decision while minimizing your risk.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Bet Sizing </h3>
<p>Effective bet sizing can help you achieve various objectives. It can help you <b>extract value</b> from your strong hands, <b>bluff effectively</b> with your weak hands, and <b>manipulate the pot size</b> to your advantage. It&#039;s a crucial tool for controlling the flow of the game and keeping your opponents off balance.</p>
<p>Moreover, understanding bet sizing can help you identify the mistakes of your opponents and exploit them. For example, if an opponent consistently over-bets the pot with weak hands, you can adjust your strategy to profit from their poor bet sizing.</p>
<h3>EXAMPLE OF &quot;BET SIZING&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a $1/$2 no-limit hold&#039;em cash game, and you&#039;ve been dealt pocket aces on the button. A player in middle position opens the pot with a raise to $6. You decide to 3-bet to $20, which is a standard size in this situation.</p>
<p>In another situation, you&#039;re on the big blind with J-10 suited and the button raises to $6. You decide to call, making the pot $13. The flop comes J-7-2, giving you top pair. You decide to make a half-pot bet of $6.50 to extract value from weaker hands and protect your hand from potential draws.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I decided to increase my bet size because I noticed my opponent tended to fold to larger bets.&quot;</li><li>&quot;By adjusting my bet sizing, I was able to maximize the value of my strong hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding bet sizing helped me exploit my opponent&#039;s betting tendencies.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.118'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Big Blind</h2>
<p>The term &quot;Big Blind&quot; is a mandatory bet made before the cards are dealt in a game of poker. It is generally the larger of two forced bets in a poker round and typically the player sitting two places to the left of the dealer puts in the Big Blind.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Big Blind </h3>
<p>The <b>Big Blind</b> is a crucial element of the betting structure in poker. It&#039;s designed to stimulate betting and ensure there&#039;s always a pot worth playing for. The Big Blind follows the <b>Small Blind</b> and is usually double the size of the Small Blind. However, the amount can vary depending on the game&#039;s stakes. The blinds are used in games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, but not in variants like Seven-Card Stud.</p>
<p>In <b>cash games</b>, the value of the Big Blind remains constant and is listed as part of the table stakes. For example, in a $1/$2 game, the Big Blind is $2. In <b>tournaments</b>, however, the value of the Big Blind increases at regular intervals to ensure the tournament progresses towards a conclusion.</p>
<h3>How the Big Blind Affects Strategy </h3>
<p>The position of the <b>Big Blind</b> is a strategically significant one. This player is the last to act before the flop, which provides an opportunity to observe others&#039; actions before deciding on their move. However, this position also carries the risk of being forced to contribute a significant amount to the pot, irrespective of the strength of their hand.</p>
<p>Playing from the Big Blind requires a good understanding of <b>hand selection</b> and <b>post-flop play</b>. Since the Big Blind has already invested in the pot, they often have better odds to see the flop, even with marginal hands. However, they also need to be capable of making tough decisions after the flop, as they will often be out of position for the rest of the betting rounds.</p>
<p>For example, if you are in the Big Blind with a weak hand and everyone folds to the Small Blind who raises, you are faced with a decision. You could fold and lose your Big Blind, call and see the flop, or raise in an attempt to steal the pot.</p>


<p>Examples:</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The player to the left of the small blind is required to post the <b>big blind</b>.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The <b>big blind</b> in this tournament increases every 15 minutes.&quot;</li><li>&quot;From the <b>big blind</b> position, you have the advantage of being the last to act pre-flop.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.119'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Big Blind Ante</h2>
<p>In the later levels of poker tournaments, an ante is introduced to further drive the action besides the incentive to enter the pot formed by the small blind and big blind. </p>
<p>Typically, the ante is paid by every player at the table. A lot of poker players and poker tournament organizers believe this slows down the game, especially when players argue over who has, and who hasn't paid their ante. </p>
<p>In tournaments operating a big blind ante, as the WSOP just announced for their high roller events, the player in the big blind pays the ante for everyone at the table. As the big blind moves every hand so does the responsibility to pay the ante.</p>

<a name='name.123'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Big Slick</h2>
<p>Big Slick is a nickname for

<q class='x'>A</q>
<q class='x'>K</q>

, which was originally called &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from the destructive oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. It eventually transformed into &quot;Big Slick.&quot;.</p>
<h3>What is a Big Slick in Poker?</h3>
<p>This is a term used to describe the Ace-King hand in Texas Hold’em Poker. It&#039;s often referred to as &quot;big slick&quot; because it&#039;s a big hand, but it can be slippery: it&#039;s got a lot of potential, but it could also lead to a big loss if not played correctly.</p>
<p><b><u>Understanding Big Slick</u></b></p>
<p>Big slick is a starting hand in <i>Texas Hold&#039;em Poker</i> that consists of an Ace and a King. These are two of the highest ranking cards you can have as a starting hand, making this a very strong, although somewhat risky, hand to play.</p>
<p>The term comes from the fact that these two cards together can be very strong – big – but also very slippery or tricky to play – slick. While you have a good high-card strength, you don&#039;t yet have a pair or any other winning poker hand, which can make strategy complicated.</p>
<p><b><u>How to play the Big Slick</u></b></p>
<p>Playing a big slick well requires a balance of aggressive and cautious play. It is not a made hand yet, but it has the potential to turn into a powerful one after the flop (the first three community cards that are dealt after the first betting round). One of the potential dangers of big slick is that, because it&#039;s so high ranking, many players overvalue it and tend to bet too aggressively pre-flop.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s a list of steps to consider when you&#039;re dealt a big slick:</p>
<ul><li>Pay attention to your position: If you’re in an early position, you could raise to scare off weaker hands. </li><li>Pay attention to the others: if the table is playing very aggressively, it can be smarter to fold a big slick pre-flop than to risk too much. </li><li>The number of players in the game: Big slick plays better in a game with fewer players. </li><li>The flop: If the flop gives you an Ace or a King, you’re in a strong position. </li></ul>
<h3>Example of &quot;Big Slick&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re dealt an Ace and King, you have Big Slick. This hand has a good chance of becoming a high pair or a straight, but it could still be beaten by any made hand like a pair, two pairs, or three of a kind.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>[] &quot;He was dealt Big Slick and decided to raise pre-flop to try and thin the field.&quot;<br/>
[] &quot;Despite having Big Slick, she decided to fold after the flop came with three low cards of different suits.&quot;</p></li><li>&quot;With Big Slick, he managed to hit a straight on the river and win a big pot.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.128'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Blind</h2>
<p>A Blind in poker is a mandatory bet that is placed by two players before any cards are dealt. There are typically two blinds in a hand: the small blind and the big blind.</p>
<h3>What is a Blind? </h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>Blind</b> is a forced bet that two players must make before any cards are dealt. There are two types of blinds: the small blind and the big blind. The small blind is usually half the size of the big blind, and is placed by the player to the left of the dealer. The big blind, placed by the player to the left of the small blind, is usually equivalent to the minimum bet.</p>
<h3>Playing from the Blinds </h3>
<p>Playing from the <b>Blinds</b> can be challenging because you will be out of position for the rest of the betting rounds. This means you will be one of the first to act, which can be a disadvantage as you have less information about what other players might do.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Dealing with Blinds </h3>
<p>When you&#039;re in the blinds, it&#039;s important to consider your hand strength, the betting action, and the tendencies of the other players. Since being in the blinds puts you at a positional disadvantage, you generally need a stronger hand to play compared to if you were in a later position.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Blind&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, in a game with a small blind of $1 and a big blind of $2, the player to the left of the dealer would place a $1 bet before the cards are dealt, and the player to their left would place a $2 bet. This creates a starting pot of $3.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Being in the big blind, he decided to call the raise with his suited connectors.&quot;</li><li>&quot;From the small blind, she decided to fold her weak hand, not wanting to commit more chips out of position.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The blinds increase in later stages of a tournament, adding pressure to the players.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.135'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Blocker</h2>
<p>The term &quot;Blocker&quot; in poker refers to holding a card that an opponent needs to complete their hand. This concept is significant as it reduces the chances of your opponent having certain combinations of cards.</p>
<h3>Detailed Explanation of Blocker in Poker </h3>
<p>In the world of poker, the term <b>blocker</b> holds significant importance. A blocker is essentially a card in your hand that prevents or &#039;<b>blocks</b>&#039; your opponent from possibly having certain combinations of cards. This strategy is equally effective in both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>, and is applicable to all poker variants like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<p>Understanding and using <b>blockers</b> can drastically influence your decision-making process in the game. For instance, if you hold the Ace of hearts, it&#039;s impossible for your opponent to have an Ace-high flush. This is because you &#039;block&#039; one of the crucial cards needed for that particular hand.</p>
<h3>Examples of Blockers in Poker </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s consider a few scenarios to better understand the concept of <b>blockers</b>.</p>
<p>You&#039;re playing Texas Hold&#039;em, and you have the King of spades. The community cards show two more spades. Here, you possess a key &#039;blocker&#039; to the flush, lessening the likelihood that your opponent can achieve a flush.</p>
<p>In an Omaha game, you&#039;re dealt two Queens. This &#039;blocks&#039; some of the potential high-ranking hands your opponent could have, like four-of-a-kind or a full house with Queens. In Omaha, blockers are even more relevant as it&#039;s easier to make hands <b>and</b> each player has more cards than in Hold&#039;em - giving them more opportunities to &#039;block&#039; opponents&#039; hands.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;I can&#039;t fold this hand; I have a major blocker.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;With a blocker in my hand, the chances of him having a flush are significantly reduced.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;She held the blocker to his straight draw, which influenced her decision to raise.&quot;</li>

<a name='name.138'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bluff</h2>
<p>The term &quot;Bluff&quot; in poker refers to a bet or raise made with a hand that is not thought to be the best hand. Bluffing is a fundamental part of poker, an attempt to make an opponent fold a better hand.</p>
<h3>The Art of Bluffing in Poker </h3>
<p>In the <b>poker</b> world, the ability to successfully <b>bluff</b> can be a real game-changer. A bluff is a bet or a raise made with a hand which is not necessarily the best hand. The intention behind a <b>bluff</b> is to make your opponent believe you have a stronger hand than you actually do, thereby leading them to fold. Bluffing plays a significant role in both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>, and is a strategy applicable to all poker variants, including Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<p>Bluffing is not just about the cards you hold, it&#039;s also about the reads you have on your opponents and your table image. Timing is crucial when bluffing. A well-timed bluff can win you a pot when your cards cannot.</p>
<h3>Examples of Bluffing in Poker </h3>
<p>Consider the following scenarios to understand the concept of <b>bluffing</b> in poker:<br/>
You&#039;re playing Texas Hold&#039;em and you have a 2 of Hearts and a 7 of Spades, widely considered the worst starting hand in the game. The flop comes Ace of Diamonds, King of Clubs, and 9 of Spades. You decide to bluff and make a large bet, representing that you have a strong hand, possibly an Ace or King, causing your opponent to fold.</p>
<p>In an Omaha game, you&#039;re dealt a hand that has little to no potential of winning. However, based on your read of your opponent and their potential hand, you decide to bluff and make a large bet, causing them to fold.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He bluffed his way to victory with nothing more than a pair of twos.&quot;</li><li>&quot;I managed to bluff in the last round and stole the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She bluffed on the river, causing her opponent to fold the better hand.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.139'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bluff Catcher</h2>
<p>The term &quot;Bluff Catcher&quot; in poker refers to a hand that can only win if the opponent is bluffing. It&#039;s a hand that, while not strong enough to bet for value, is strong enough to beat a bluff if called.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Bluff Catcher </h3>
<p>In the world of <b>poker</b>, a <b>Bluff Catcher</b> is a hand that has marginal value on its own but can prove useful when an opponent is likely bluffing. It&#039;s a hand that&#039;s not strong enough to bet for value, but it could still win at showdown if the opponent indeed was bluffing. Knowing when to use a bluff catcher can be a critical part of strategy, especially in games with a lot of aggressive players.</p>
<h3>When to Use a Bluff Catcher </h3>
<p>Understanding when to use a <b>Bluff Catcher</b> requires a strong understanding of your opponent&#039;s tendencies and betting patterns. If an opponent frequently bluffs, then your chances of successfully using a bluff catcher increase. Likewise, if your opponent is conservative and rarely bluffs, a bluff catcher becomes less effective. It&#039;s all about reading the table and making informed decisions.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Bluff Catcher&quot; </h3>
<p>Here&#039;s an example of a bluff catcher in poker. Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing Texas Hold&#039;em, and you&#039;re holding a hand of 8-9 suited. The flop comes 7-10-Jack, giving you a straight. The turn is a Queen, and the river is a King. Now, any Ace or 9 gives your opponent a higher straight. If your opponent makes a big bet, your hand becomes a bluff catcher. You can only win if your opponent is bluffing and does not hold an Ace or 9.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I knew he was bluffing, so I called with my bluff catcher.&quot;</li><li>&quot;My hand was a bluff catcher, but I decided to fold because I knew my opponent rarely bluffs.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a bluff catcher, I couldn&#039;t risk the call.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.140'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Board</h2>
<p>The Board in poker refers to the community cards that are dealt face-up on the &quot;table&quot;. In games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, these cards can be used by all players to form their best hand.</p>
<h3>What is the Board? </h3>
<p>In poker, the <b>Board</b> refers to the community cards that are dealt face-up in the middle of the table. In Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, these are the cards that all players can use in combination with their hole cards to make their best five-card poker hand. The Board consists of the flop, the turn, and the river cards.</p>
<h3>Reading the Board </h3>
<p>Reading the <b>Board</b> is a key skill in poker. It involves assessing the community cards to understand what potential hands can be made. Players must consider the Board in relation to their own hole cards to determine the strength of their hand, as well as consider what potential hands their opponents could have based on the Board.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Dealing with the Board </h3>
<p>When dealing with the Board, it&#039;s important to consider the range of hands that the Board allows. For example, a Board with consecutive cards of the same suit could allow for flushes and straights, while a Board with pairs or triplets could allow for full houses or four of a kind.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Board&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if the community cards are 2, 7, Jack, Queen, and King, this is referred to as the Board. Players would then use these cards in combination with their hole cards to form their best possible poker hand.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The Board showed 3, 4, and 5 of hearts, increasing the chances of a flush.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With an Ace and King in his hand, the Queen, Jack, and 10 on the Board gave him a straight.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The Board paired on the river, causing her two pair hand to improve to a full house.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.144'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bomb Pot</h2>
<p>The term &quot;Bomb Pot&quot; in poker refers to a special type of hand where all players at the table agree to put in a predetermined amount of money into the pot before the flop is dealt. After the bet, the hand proceeds as normal. Typically, bomb pots occur once every orbit at a table and are more common in cash games than tournaments.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Bomb Pot Poker Rules </h3>
<p>In <b>Bomb Pot</b> poker, all players agree to place a <b>predetermined bet</b> before the flop is dealt. This creates a larger initial pot, making the hand more exciting and potentially rewarding. Bomb pots are especially popular in <b>cash games</b>, although they can occur in tournaments as well. The key aspect that distinguishes a bomb pot from a regular hand is the <b>mandatory pre-flop betting</b> by all players.</p>
<h3>Playing a Bomb Pot Poker Hand </h3>
<p>When a bomb pot is declared, each player must put in the agreed-upon amount of money into the pot. This is done before the flop, and no player can opt out if they wish to participate in the hand. Once the bet is placed and the flop is dealt, the hand continues as normal. Players can <b>check, bet, raise, or fold</b>, depending on their hand and the strategy they wish to employ. It&#039;s important to note that bomb pots can lead to <b>larger pots</b> than typical hands, which can add a thrilling element to the game.</p>
<p>Examples of situations that clarify the meaning of a bomb pot might include:</p>
<p>All players at a table agree to a $5 bomb pot. Each player puts $5 into the pot before the flop is dealt.<br/>
A bomb pot is declared at a tournament table. All players must place the agreed-upon bet into the pot if they wish to participate in the hand.</p>
<p>Final sentences containing the term &quot;Bomb Pot&quot; could include:</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The table agreed to a $10 bomb pot, making the initial pot much larger than usual.&quot;</li><li>&quot;In the bomb pot, all players had to make a predetermined bet before the flop was dealt.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The bomb pot added an exciting twist to the cash game, with larger pots up for grabs.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.147'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Bounty</h2>
<p>A &#039;<b>Bounty</b>&#039; in poker is a monetary prize awarded to a player who eliminates another player from the tournament. This prize is typically a portion of the eliminated player&#039;s buy-in and adds an extra layer of excitement and strategy to the game.</p>
<h3>What is a Bounty in Poker? </h3>
<p>In <b>bounty tournaments</b>, each player carries a bounty that gets claimed by whoever knocks them out. This means that apart from the traditional tournament prizes, players have the opportunity to win extra cash each time they eliminate an opponent. This feature adds an additional dimension of strategy to the game, as players might adjust their play to try and claim more bounties.</p>
<h3>How do Bounties Work in Poker? </h3>
<p>In a bounty tournament, part of your buy-in goes towards the tournament prize pool, and another part becomes your bounty. The exact split may vary, but a common structure is a 50/50 divide. So, if the buy-in is $200, $100 would go to the prize pool, and the other $100 becomes your bounty.</p>
<p>When you knock out another player, you win their bounty. In some tournaments, known as progressive knockout (PKO) tournaments, you only receive a portion of the bounty (typically 50%), and the rest gets added to your own bounty, making you a more appealing target for other players.</p>
<h3>Strategies Around Bounties </h3>
<p>Bounties can significantly influence the dynamics of a poker tournament. Players may be more willing to take risks if they have the opportunity to win a bounty, resulting in more aggressive play. Conversely, if you have a large bounty on your head, you might find yourself being targeted by other players.</p>
<p>Understanding the value of bounties and adjusting your strategy accordingly is crucial to succeeding in bounty tournaments. You need to carefully weigh the potential reward of claiming a bounty against the risk of losing chips or being eliminated from the tournament.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Bounty&quot; </h3>
<p>Suppose you&#039;re in a bounty tournament with a buy-in of $200, and the bounty is set at $100. You&#039;re dealt a strong hand and are up against a single opponent on the flop. Considering the added incentive of the $100 bounty, you decide to go all-in. Your opponent calls, and you win, eliminating them from the tournament. You&#039;ve just claimed your first bounty of the game.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;After knocking out four players in the bounty tournament, she collected their bounties.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With a large bounty on his head, he became a prime target at the table.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She adjusted her strategy to try and collect as many bounties as possible.&quot;</li></ul>
<h3>Bounty in Poker FAQs </h3>
<p>[FAQ]<br/>

<p>Q: Do all poker tournaments have bounties?<br/>

In other tournaments, bounties are set at a single amount and you will just earn that amount regardless of any other knockouts.</p>

<p>A card turned the wrong way in a deck. A card encountered face-up in the assembled deck during the deal, as opposed to one overturned in the act of dealing.

<a name='name.149'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Brick</h2>
<p>A Brick in poker refers to a card that appears to be of no value and does not seem to improve anyone&#039;s hand.</p>
<h3>What is a Brick? </h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>Brick</b> is a term used to describe a card that appears to have no value and doesn&#039;t seem to help any player&#039;s hand. These cards are often inconsequential to the outcome of the hand. They&#039;re typically cards that don&#039;t complete potential draws or don&#039;t match with the existing community cards.</p>
<h3>Dealing with Bricks </h3>
<p>When dealing with <b>Bricks</b>, it&#039;s important to consider how this card might affect the strategy of your opponents. Even though the card may seem to have no value, it might still influence the betting behavior of your opponents, especially if they&#039;re trying to bluff.</p>
<h3>Considerations When a Brick is Dealt </h3>
<p>When a Brick is dealt, it&#039;s important to consider how this card affects the overall hand. It might not improve your hand, but it also doesn&#039;t improve the hands of your opponents. This could be an opportunity to bluff or to continue with a strong betting strategy if you already have a strong hand.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Brick&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if the community cards are showing a potential flush draw and the turn card is a card of a different suit, this card could be considered a Brick, as it doesn&#039;t complete the flush draw.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The turn was a Brick, not helping him complete his straight draw.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She decided to bluff after a Brick was dealt on the river, hoping her opponents would believe she had a strong hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Dealing with Bricks is a part of poker strategy, as they can sometimes provide opportunities to bluff.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>In poker, the term &quot;Bubble&quot; refers to the point in a poker tournament where the next player to be eliminated will fall just short of receiving a payout. It is a critical phase of the tournament that significantly influences players&#039; strategies.</p>
<h3>The Concept of Bubble in Poker</h3>
<p>In the realm of <b>poker</b>, the term <b>bubble</b> denotes a crucial phase in a <b>poker tournament</b>. This phase is when the next player to be knocked out will not receive any payout, while all remaining players will. The <b>bubble</b> phase greatly impacts the dynamics of the game, influencing both the pace of play and players&#039; strategies. This concept is applicable in all forms of poker tournaments, including Texas Hold&#039;em, Omaha, and others.</p>
<p>During the <b>bubble</b> phase, players&#039; strategies diverge significantly based on their stack sizes. Players with larger stacks can apply pressure on short-stacked players, who are trying to survive the bubble and secure a payout.</p>
<h3>Examples of Bubble Phase in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the <b>bubble</b> phase in poker:<br/>
You&#039;re playing in a Texas Hold&#039;em tournament with 100 entrants, and the top 15 get paid. When there are 16 players left, you are on the bubble.</p>

<a name='name.166'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Burn Card</h2>
<p>A burn card is a card that is removed from the top of the deck and discarded without being revealed to the players. This is done before community cards are dealt in games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, as a means of ensuring fairness and preventing cheating.</p>
<h3>What is a Burn Card? </h3>
<p>A <b>burn card</b> is a common practice in both live and online poker games. It is the card that the dealer discards from the top of the deck, face down, before dealing the community cards. This is done in games like <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b> and <b>Omaha</b> to ensure fairness and prevent any form of cheating. The burn card is not revealed to the players and has no influence on the game&#039;s outcome.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Burn Card </h3>
<p>The primary purpose of the <b>burn card</b> is to protect the integrity of the game. In a live poker game, it&#039;s possible for players to mark the cards or gain some knowledge about the cards based on dealer&#039;s handling. By burning a card, it ensures that even if a player has gained some information about the top card, it will not affect the game as that card gets discarded.</p>
<h3>A Burn Card in Different Poker Games </h3>
<p>In <b>Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha</b>, the dealer burns a card before the flop, the turn, and the river. This means three cards are burned in total. In <b>Seven-Card Stud</b>, the dealer burns a card before dealing the final card. In draw poker games, no cards are burned.</p>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, once the first round of betting is complete, the dealer will burn one card and then deal the flop. After the second round of betting, another card is burned before dealing the turn, and the same happens before dealing the river.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The dealer burned a card before dealing the flop.&quot;</li><li>&quot;After burning a card, the dealer revealed the river.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Three cards were burned in total in that game of Texas Hold&#039;em.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.172'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Button</h2>
<p>The Button in poker refers to a marker used to identify the dealer in the current hand. It&#039;s also used to determine the betting order in a round of poker.</p>
<h3>What is the Button? </h3>
<p>In poker, the <b>Button</b> is a marker used to signify who would be the dealer in a real money game. In a casino or professional setting where there is a dedicated dealer, the button still rotates around the table to determine the order of betting. The player to the left of the button acts first in betting rounds after the flop, while the player on the button acts last.</p>
<h3>Significance of the Button </h3>
<p>The <b>Button</b> holds significant strategic value in poker. The player on the button acts last in betting rounds, giving them the advantage of seeing how other players act before they have to make a decision. This position is often seen as the most advantageous in poker.</p>
<h3>Considerations When You&#039;re on the Button </h3>
<p>When you&#039;re on the button, it&#039;s important to leverage your position. You have the advantage of acting last, which gives you more information about the other players&#039; hands based on their actions. This is a good position to play more hands from, as you have more information when making decisions.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Button&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player is on the button and everyone else at the table has folded, they can make a decision to raise, call, or fold with the benefit of having seen how all other players have acted.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Being on the button gave him the advantage of acting last in the betting round.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She decided to raise from the button, leveraging her position to put pressure on the blinds.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding the importance of the button is crucial to successful poker strategy.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.173'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Button War</h2>
<p>In poker, a &quot;Button War&quot; refers to a situation where players in late positions, specifically the dealer (button) and the cut-off, frequently and aggressively compete against each other. This usually involves a lot of raising and re-raising, trying to assert dominance and control over the table.</p>
<h3>Understanding Button Wars in Poker </h3>
<p>In the <b>poker</b> environment, a <b>Button War</b> is a situation where the players in the dealer (button) and cut-off positions engage in constant battle. This often takes the form of aggressive betting, raising, and re-raising. The term is applicable across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and can be seen in both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>button</b> is the most advantageous position in poker because you act last in betting rounds. This positional advantage often leads to the button and cut-off players frequently clashing, each trying to exploit their late position.</p>
<h3>Examples of Button Wars in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are a few situations that illustrate the concept of <b>Button Wars</b> in poker:<br/>
In a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, the player in the cut-off position frequently raises when the action folds to them, trying to steal the blinds. However, the player on the button doesn&#039;t back down and often re-raises, leading to a Button War.</p>
<p>During an Omaha tournament, the player on the button consistently raises to assert dominance and control over the table. The cut-off player, recognizing this strategy, starts to fight back with their own raises, leading to a Button War.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The aggressive player on the button initiated a button war with constant re-raises.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She found herself in the middle of a button war between the two aggressive players to her right.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He decided to fight back against the button&#039;s dominance, leading to a fierce button war.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.175'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Buy-In</h2>
<p>In poker, a &quot;Buy-In&quot; refers to the amount of money a player pays to join a poker game or tournament. It&#039;s the initial investment a player makes to receive their starting chips.</p>
<h3>Understanding Buy-In in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, a <b>Buy-In</b> refers to the amount of money a player pays to participate in a poker game or tournament. This term is used across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and applies to both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>The buy-in is the player&#039;s initial investment to receive their starting chips. In a cash game, the buy-in is typically expressed as a range (e.g., $100-$200) and players can usually buy more chips between hands if they lose their initial buy-in. In a tournament, the buy-in is a fixed amount, and all players start with the same number of chips.</p>
<p>Typically, the buy-in of a game of poker will closely collate with the difficulty of the game. For instance, if you&#039;re playing a $1 tournament, it&#039;s considered &#039;micro-stakes&#039; and will usually be a much easier tournament to play in terms of opponent skill level compared to larger buy in tournaments. Equally, a $10,000 tournament will likely be one of the most difficult poker levels. There are exceptions to this, but usually, the higher the buy-in the harder the game.</p>
<h3>Examples of Buy-In in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of a <b>Buy-In</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em cash game with a buy-in range of $100-$500, a player could choose to buy in for any amount within that range.<br/>
In a poker tournament with a buy-in of $50, each player would pay $50 to enter the tournament and receive the same starting amount of chips.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to buy in for the maximum amount to give himself a deep stack to start the game.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The poker tournament had a buy-in of $200, making it a significant investment for many players.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Understanding the concept of buy-ins can help you manage your poker bankroll effectively.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>Blind vs. Blind, This term describes a situation where the two players in the blinds (the small blind and the big blind) are the only players involved in a hand. This often leads to unique dynamics since both players have already committed chips to the pot, and the action typically occurs between them without any other players participating.</p>
