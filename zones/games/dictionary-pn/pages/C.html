<p>A set of cardroom games, formerly called Asian games, some of which resemble poker, but are not strictly poker, in which players place bets before receiving the hands on which they wager; others resemble blackjack. In these games, to get around the legal restriction against banking games, the only interest the house has is to take a portion of every bet; one player acts as banker, playing one hand against each player in turn. These games include pai gow (played with tiles, and not a card game at all), pai gow poker, super nine (also called super pan nine), California blackjack (also called X blackjack, where X is the name of the club), California Aces (a variant of blackjack in which the object is to get closest to 22, with two aces being the best hand; similarly often called X aces), 13-card (not played with a banker).</p>

<a name='name.181'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Call</h2>
<p>In poker, the term &quot;call&quot; refers to matching the current highest bet in the round. It&#039;s a way to stay in the hand without raising the stakes.</p>
<h3>What is a Call in Poker?</h3>
<p>A call in poker is a betting action where a player chooses to match the current highest bet in order to stay in the hand. This term is used in all variants of poker, whether you&#039;re playing online or live, in both cash games and tournaments.</p>
<p>In poker, the term &quot;call&quot; is a fundamental part of the game&#039;s <b>strategy</b> and <b>betting system</b>. By calling, a player can stay in the hand without increasing the bet. This move can be used in various <b>game situations</b> and is a key aspect of <b>poker tactics</b>.</p>
<h3>When to Call in Poker</h3>
<p>Deciding when to call in poker can be a strategic decision based on several factors. These include the strength of your hand, the <b>betting pattern</b> of your opponents, and your position at the table.</p>
<p>A call is often made when a player believes they have a good chance of winning the hand, but doesn&#039;t want to risk raising the bet. It&#039;s a more cautious move that allows the player to stay in the game without making a more aggressive play. However, it can also be used when a player has a very strong hand, in order to conceal the strength of their hand and get further value on future streets. Alternatively, players with a weak hand like a draw, who might know they&#039;re behind, may choose to call to see if they hit their hand on later streets.</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Call&quot;</h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em poker. The player before you bets $10. You believe you have a strong hand, but you&#039;re not confident enough to raise. To stay in the hand, you decide to &quot;call&quot; by matching the current highest bet of $10. Your hand is not weak enough to fold as you have some equity and a realistic chance of winning, but you&#039;re not strong enough to raise to try get extra value.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I&#039;m not sure if I have the best hand, so I&#039;ll just call.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He bet $50, and I think I can win, so I&#039;m going to call.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She&#039;s been bluffing all night, so I&#039;m going to call her bet and see what she really has.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.185'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Cap</h2>
<p>A Cap in poker refers to the limit on the number of raises allowed in a round of betting. It&#039;s typically used in Fixed-Limit poker games to control the size of the pot.</p>
<h3>What is a Cap? </h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>Cap</b> refers to the limit on the number of raises that can be made during a single round of betting. Once the Cap is reached, no further raises are allowed until the next betting round. Capping is generally used in Fixed-Limit poker games as a way to control the size of the pot and prevent it from growing too large.</p>
<h3>When to Consider the Cap </h3>
<p>Considering the <b>Cap</b> is essential when deciding your betting strategy in a hand. If the Cap has been reached and you want to increase the pot further, you&#039;ll need to wait until the next betting round. Similarly, if you&#039;re facing aggressive opponents who are raising frequently, the Cap can provide some protection by limiting the amount you&#039;ll need to call.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Dealing with the Cap </h3>
<p>When dealing with the Cap, it&#039;s important to consider your hand strength, your opponents&#039; betting patterns, and the size of the pot. If the Cap has been reached and you have a strong hand, it may be beneficial to call and see the next card. However, if you have a weak hand and the pot is large, it might be better to fold.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Cap&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, in a Fixed-Limit Hold&#039;em game with a limit of four raises, once four raises have been made during a single betting round, the Cap is reached and no further raises can be made until the next betting round.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With a strong hand, he decided to raise, reaching the Cap for the betting round.&quot;</li><li>&quot;After the Cap was reached, she decided to call and see the next card.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Knowing the Cap had been reached provided some relief, as he wouldn&#039;t be forced to call any more raises during this betting round.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>In the game of poker, &quot;check&quot; is a betting action where a player chooses not to place a bet, passing the action to the next player. This option is only available if no bets have been placed in the current betting round.</p>
<h3>What is a Check in Poker?</h3>
<p>A check in poker is a betting move that a player can make when it&#039;s their turn to act and no bets have been placed in the current betting round. This action essentially means that the player chooses not to bet, passing the action on to the next player.</p>
<p>Checking is a key part of <b>poker strategy</b> and the <b>betting system</b>. It allows players to stay in the hand without adding more money to the pot. This move is commonly used in all kinds of poker games, whether played online, live, in cash games, or tournaments.</p>
<h3>When to Check in Poker</h3>
<p>The decision to check in poker can be influenced by various factors, including the strength of the player&#039;s hand, their position at the table, and the <b>betting pattern</b> of the other players.</p>
<p>A player might choose to check when they have a weak hand and don&#039;t want to add more money to the pot, or when they have a strong hand and want to induce their opponents to bet. However, a player could also check if they have a decently strong hand, but are not too sure whether or not they&#039;re ahead in the pot. This is a safe option - as they won&#039;t inflate the pot and potentially lose a larger amount of chips. Understanding when to check and when to bet is a critical aspect of successful <b>poker play</b> and <b>strategy</b>.</p>
<h3>Example of a Check in Poker</h3>
<p>Imagine you&#039;re playing a round of Texas Hold&#039;em poker. It&#039;s the first betting round, and you&#039;re the first one to act. You look at your hole cards and see that they&#039;re not particularly strong. Instead of betting, you decide to &quot;check&quot;, passing the action on to the next player without putting any money into the pot.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I don&#039;t have a strong hand, so I&#039;m going to check.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He checked, so I&#039;ll check too and see the next card.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She&#039;s been aggressive all night, so I&#039;m going to check and see what she does.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>To check without looking at one's own cards. Also Check in the Dark</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.204'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Check in the Dark</h2>
<p>A &#039;Check in the Dark&#039; in poker is a move where a player announces a check before the next card is dealt. This move is made without the player seeing the next card or the actions of any other players who act before them.</p>
<h3>What is a Check in the Dark in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Check in the Dark&#039; is an action where a player announces that they will check on the next betting round, before the next card is dealt. This declaration is binding, and the player must check when it is their turn to act, regardless of the actions of other players or the card that is dealt next.</p>
<h3>The Strategy of Checking in the Dark </h3>
<p>The decision to check in the dark is typically a defensive move. A player might choose to check in the dark when they have a hand that is marginal or weak and they want to see the next card without committing any more money to the pot. This move is often used in situations where a player is unsure of the strength of their hand and wants to avoid a situation where they might be raised if they check.</p>
<p>However, it&#039;s important to note that checking in the dark can be a risky strategy because it gives up the opportunity to react to the actions of other players or the next card that is dealt. It can also signal weakness to observant opponents, who might take advantage of this information.</p>
<h3>When to Check in the Dark </h3>
<p>Choosing when to check in the dark should be based on the specific circumstances of the hand. Here are some situations where checking in the dark might be a good move:<br/>
You have a marginal hand and you want to see the next card without committing any more money to the pot.<br/>
You&#039;re in a late position and you want to avoid being raised by an aggressive player in an earlier position.<br/>
You&#039;re trying to confuse your opponents or disrupt their betting patterns.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Check in the Dark&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a marginal hand. The flop comes and it doesn&#039;t improve your hand. Before the turn is dealt, you announce a check in the dark, signaling that you will not bet on the next round of betting.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With a weak hand on the flop, he decided to check in the dark before the turn.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She announced a check in the dark, hoping to see the river card without any further bets.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having an unimproved hand on the flop, he decided to check in the dark to confuse his opponents.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.205'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Check-Raise</h2>
<p>A &#039;Check-raise&#039; in poker is a strategic move where a player first checks their option to bet and then raises when an opponent bets on the same round of betting. This tactic is often used to trap an opponent or build a larger pot when a player has a strong hand.</p>
<h3>What is a Check-Raise in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Check-raise&#039; is a deceptive play that involves first checking and then raising in the same round of betting. This move is typically used when a player has a strong hand and wants to induce their opponents to bet more, or as a bluff to make opponents fold a better hand.</p>
<h3>The Strategy of Check-Raising </h3>
<p>The check-raise can be a powerful tool in a poker player&#039;s arsenal, but it should be used sparingly and in the right situations. When used effectively, a check-raise can create confusion and uncertainty in an opponent&#039;s mind, leading them to make mistakes.</p>
<p>One common situation where a check-raise might be used is when a player has a very strong hand and they want to build the pot. By checking, they encourage their opponents to bet, and then by raising, they force their opponents to put even more money into the pot.</p>
<p>A check-raise can also be used as a bluffing strategy, particularly against aggressive players who are likely to bet when checked to. By check-raising, a player can potentially force their opponent to fold a better hand.</p>
<h3>When to Check-Raise </h3>
<p>Deciding when to check-raise depends on a variety of factors, including the strength of your hand, the tendencies of your opponents, and your position at the table. Here are a few situations when a check-raise might be a good move:<br/>
You have a strong hand and want to build the pot.<br/>
You believe your opponent is likely to bet if you check.<br/>
You want to bluff an aggressive player out of the pot.<br/>
You have a drawing hand and want to take control of the pot.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Check-Raise&quot; </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a pair of aces. The flop comes and you hit a set. You decide to check, hoping to induce a bet from your opponent. Your opponent does bet, and then you raise, forcing your opponent to put more money into the pot or fold.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He check-raised on the flop with his flush draw, taking control of the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;After hitting a full house on the turn, she decided to check-raise to build the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He used a check-raise bluff to force his opponent to fold the better hand.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.208'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Chop</h2>
<p>A Chop in poker refers to a situation where the pot is divided equally between two or more players. This typically occurs when players have equal hands or in a tournament setting when players agree to split the prize money.</p>
<h3>What is a Chop? </h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>Chop</b> refers to a situation where the pot is split evenly between two or more players. This typically happens when two or more players have equal hands at the showdown. In tournament play, a chop can also refer to an agreement between remaining players to split the prize money equally, or according to chip counts, rather than playing the tournament to the end.</p>
<h3>When Does a Chop Occur? </h3>
<p>A <b>Chop</b> can occur in several situations. The most common is at the showdown when two or more players have equal hands. For example, if two players both have a pair of aces, the pot would be chopped. In a tournament, a chop can occur when the remaining players agree to divide the prize money rather than continue playing.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Agreeing to a Chop </h3>
<p>When considering a chop in a tournament, it&#039;s important to take into account factors such as your chip stack, your perceived skill level compared to the remaining players, and the payout structure. Sometimes, it might be more profitable to play the tournament to the end, while other times, a chop might be the best option.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Chop&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if two players in a Texas Hold&#039;em game both have a pair of aces with a king as their highest kicker, and no better hand is possible using the community cards, they would chop the pot.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Both players had the same straight, so they decided to chop the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;As the last two players in the tournament, they agreed to chop the remaining prize money.&quot;</li><li>&quot;A chop can often be a fair resolution when players have equal hands or when tournament players want to reduce variance.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.209'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Chopping Blinds</h2>
<p>Chopping Blinds in poker refers to a situation where all players fold to the small blind, and both the small blind and big blind decide to take back their bets and move on to the next hand.</p>
<h3>What is Chopping Blinds? </h3>
<p>In poker, <b>Chopping Blinds</b> occurs when all players fold to the small blind in a hand, and the small blind and big blind mutually decide to take back their blinds rather than play the hand. This effectively ends the hand, and a new one begins. It is a common practice in cash games to speed up play, especially in situations where the blinds do not want to play a hand heads-up.</p>
<h3>When to Chop Blinds </h3>
<p>Deciding whether to chop blinds can depend on several factors, including the relative hand strengths of the small blind and big blind, the tendencies of the players, and the game strategy. Some players prefer to always chop blinds when given the opportunity, while others may choose to play the hand if they have a strong starting hand.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Chopping Blinds </h3>
<p>When you have the option to chop blinds, it&#039;s important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks. Chopping blinds can speed up the game and reduce the variance associated with playing out a large number of hands heads-up. However, if you have a strong hand or if you&#039;re in a position to potentially win more chips, it might be more profitable to play the hand.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Chopping Blinds&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, in a cash game, if all players fold to the small blind, the small blind and big blind may agree to chop the blinds. They would both retrieve their blind bets and a new hand would begin.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;With weak hands in the small blind and big blind, they agreed to chop the blinds and move on to the next hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Even though they often chopped blinds, he decided to play the hand after looking down at pocket aces.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Chopping blinds can be a good strategy to keep the game moving in a friendly cash game.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.213'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Coin Flip</h2>
<p>In poker, a &quot;Coin Flip&quot; or &quot;Flip&quot; refers to a situation where two players with different types of hands have nearly equal chances of winning the pot, typically around 50-50, much like flipping a coin.</p>
<h3>What is a Coin Flip in Poker?</h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, a <b>Coin Flip</b> or <b>Flip</b> is a scenario where two players have almost the same probability of winning, generally around 50-50. This term is common across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and occurs in both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>Typically, a coin flip situation arises when one player has a pair and the other has two overcards. Neither player has a significant edge over the other pre-flop. The outcome, much like flipping a coin, is almost equally likely to go one way or the other.</p>
<h3>Examples of Coin Flip in Poker </h3>
<p>To better understand the concept of a <b>Coin Flip</b> in poker, consider these examples:<br/>
In a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, one player holds a pair of 8s, and another player holds Ace-King. Before the flop, both players have approximately equal chances of winning the hand.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, one player has a pair of Queens, and another has Ace-Jack. This is another typical coin flip situation.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He found himself in a coin flip situation with pocket fives against Ace-King.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She decided to take a risk and go all-in, knowing it was a coin flip.&quot;</li><li>&quot;In a coin flip scenario, he had as much chance of winning as losing.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.214'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Cold Call</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;Cold Call&quot; refers to a situation when a player calls a raise after there has already been a bet and one or more raises. A player cold calls when they neither originally bet nor raised the bet.</p>
<h3>Grasping Cold Call in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, a <b>Cold Call</b> is when a player calls a raise without having already put any money in the pot in the form of a bet or a raise. The term is prevalent in all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and it applies to both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>A cold call usually indicates a player has a decent hand, not strong enough to raise but too good to fold. It&#039;s a move that requires a solid understanding of poker strategy and knowledge of opponents&#039; tendencies.</p>
<h3>Examples of Cold Call in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of <b>Cold Call</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, the player under the gun raises, and the next player re-raises. The action comes to you, and you decide to call the re-raise, thus making a cold call.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, one player makes a bet, another player raises, and you decide to call the raised amount, which is a cold call.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to cold call the big raise with his pocket Jacks.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite the hefty raise, she made a cold call, hoping to hit a flush on the flop.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The action was intense, with a bet, a raise, and then a cold call.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>A &quot;cold bet&quot; or &quot;cold raise&quot; similarly refers to a raise made against multiple players.  E.g., &quot;Fred opened for $20, Gary raised to $50, then it folded to Hank who <i>cold four-bet</i> to $100.&quot;</p>

<a name='name.220'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Collusion</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;collusion&quot; refers to a form of cheating where two or more players conspire to cheat the others at the table. This unethical practice can occur in both live and online games, and is strictly against the rules.</p>
<h3>What is Collusion in Poker?</h3>
<p>Collusion in poker is a form of cheating where two or more players work together to gain an unfair advantage over the others at the table. This could involve sharing information about their hands, coordinating their betting to manipulate the pot size, or any other actions that break the rules of fair play.</p>
<p>Collusion is considered a serious violation of the <b>poker code of conduct</b> and is strictly prohibited in all forms of the game, whether online or live, in both cash games and tournaments. Being caught colluding can result in severe penalties, including being banned from a <b>poker platform</b> or <b>casino</b>.</p>
<h3>How is Collusion Detected and Prevented in Poker?</h3>
<p>Detecting collusion in poker can be challenging, especially in online games. However, there are several signs that might indicate collusion, such as players consistently betting and folding in ways that benefit each other, or a player consistently winning against a specific opponent.</p>
<p>Most <b>online poker sites</b> use sophisticated <b>anti-collusion software</b> to detect unusual patterns of play and investigate suspicious activity. Players can also report suspected collusion to the game operator.</p>
<p>Preventing collusion involves maintaining a high level of <b>integrity</b> and <b>fair play</b> in the game. Players should always play honestly, respect the rules, and report any suspected cheating.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Collusion&quot;</h3>
<p>An example of collusion could be two players who are secretly working together in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em. They might share information about their hands through a separate communication channel, and coordinate their betting to manipulate the pot size and deceive the other players. Remember, this type of behavior is against the rules and can result in severe penalties.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I suspect those two players might be colluding, their betting patterns are too synchronized.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Collusion is against the rules and goes against the spirit of fair play in poker.&quot;</li><li>&quot;If you suspect collusion, report it to the game operator immediately.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>In some cases, having a “combo draw” on the flop can give a player a better chance of winning than having a made hand, such as in the above example where <q class='c'>T</q><q class='c'>9</q> will win by showdown more than 56% of the time versus <q class='d'>K</q><q class='h'>K</q>’s almost 44%.</p>

<p>In poker, &quot;Community Cards&quot; refer to the cards that are dealt face-up in the middle of the table and are shared by all players to make their best hand. In games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, the community cards include the &quot;flop,&quot; &quot;turn,&quot; and &quot;river.&quot;</p>
<h3>Decoding Community Cards in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, the term <b>Community Cards</b> refers to the cards dealt face-up in the center of the table. These cards are shared by all players to make their best possible hand. The definition of community cards is applicable in poker variants such as <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b> and Omaha, both in <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>In a typical game, the community cards consist of the &quot;flop&quot; (the first three cards), the &quot;turn&quot; (the fourth card), and the &quot;river&quot; (the fifth and final card). These cards are revealed in multiple betting rounds, allowing the game dynamics and players&#039; hand strengths to change dramatically.</p>
<h3>Examples of Community Cards in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of <b>Community Cards</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, after the initial round of betting (pre-flop), the dealer places three community cards (the flop) on the table. All players can use these cards to make their best hand.</p>
<p>In an Omaha game, after the flop is dealt, a fourth community card (the turn) is placed on the table, followed by another round of betting. Then the fifth and final community card is dealt (the river) and a final round of betting takes place.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The flop didn&#039;t improve his hand, but the turn and river community cards gave him a flush.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She was hoping the community cards would give her a straight, but they ended up pairing her opponent instead.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The community cards can be a game-changer, turning a weak hand into a strong one.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.233'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Connector</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;connector&quot; refers to two or more consecutive cards that have the potential to form a straight. This term is often used in Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha, both in live and online games, and in both cash games and tournaments.</p>
<h3>What is a Connector in Poker?</h3>
<p>A connector in poker is a term used to describe two or more consecutive cards in a player&#039;s hand. These cards have the potential to form a straight, which makes them a valuable combination in games like Texas Hold&#039;em and Omaha.</p>
<p>Connectors can be a significant part of a <b>poker strategy</b> as they increase the chances of forming a strong hand. They can be particularly potent in <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b> and <b>Omaha</b>, where the objective is to make the best five-card hand possible.</p>
<p>While connectors are often very good hands to have, they are not made hands like a pocket pair. You still need certain cards to come on the streets to help you make a hand. However, if and when you do make either a straight or flush from your connectors, you&#039;ll often be in a great position to earn value and win the hand.</p>
<h3>Types of Connectors in Poker</h3>
<p>In poker, connectors can be classified into two main types: <b>suited connectors</b> and <b>unsuited connectors</b>.</p>
<p>Suited connectors are two consecutive cards of the same suit, giving the player the potential to form a straight, a flush, or even a straight flush. Unsuited connectors, on the other hand, are consecutive cards of different suits. While they can still form a straight, their potential to form a flush is removed.</p>
<p>Understanding the difference between these two types of connectors, and knowing when and how to play them, is an important aspect of <b>poker strategy</b>.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Connector&quot;</h3>
<p>An example of a connector in poker would be holding a 5 and a 6 in your hand in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em. These cards are consecutive, meaning they have higher potential of forming a straight if the right cards come up on the flop, turn, or river.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I have a connector in my hand, so I have a good chance of making a straight.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He played his suited connector aggressively and made a straight flush.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She folded her hand as she only had an unsuited connector and the flop didn&#039;t help her.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.237'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Continuation Bet</h2>
<p>A bet made by a player after having raised on an earlier round, such as in hold&#039;em when a player raises preflop and then bets after the flop.  The bet allows the preflop raise to &quot;continue&quot; with the lead in the hand. </p>

<h3>C-bet Explained - What is c-betting in poker?</h3>
<p>C-betting, short for continuation betting, is a common strategy in poker where a player who has raised before the flop (pre-flop) also bets on the flop, regardless of whether they hit the board or not. </p>
<p>This is done to maintain aggression and control the pot, as it forces opponents to either fold or call with weaker hands. C-betting is especially effective when few opponents are left in the hand or when the flop is unlikely to have helped their range of hands. However, c-betting should not be done blindly, as opponents may catch on to this strategy and start to call or raise with stronger hands.</p>
<h3>Examples of a C-bet in Poker</h3>
<ul><li><b>When you have a strong hand:</b> When a player has a strong hand pre-flop and bets on the flop to continue the aggression. This puts pressure on opponents with weaker hands to fold or pay to see the next community card.</li><li><b>When you have missed the flop:</b> When a player raises pre-flop but misses the flop, they can still c-bet to bluff and maintain control of the pot. This forces opponents to make a decision with incomplete information about the strength of the player&#039;s hand.</li><li><b>When you have the positional advantage:</b> When a player is in a late position, they can c-bet to steal the pot as their opponents may have weaker hands due to being out of position. This can also help the player to gain information about their opponent&#039;s hand.</li></ul>

<h3>Advantages of C-betting - Why C-bet in Poker?</h3>
<p>C-betting in poker is an effective strategy to maintain control of the pot and force opponents with weaker hands to make difficult decisions. </p>
<p>C-betting and aggression is generally good practice in poker, assuming the flop is the right texture. </p>
<h4>C-bet to…Take down the pot </h4>
<p>C-betting in poker is a valuable tool to take down the pot even when a player&#039;s hand is weak. By raising preflop, a player can represent having a strong hand and then bet again on the flop to continue the aggression. </p>
<p>This puts pressure on the opponents with weaker hands to either fold or pay to see the next community card. If executed correctly, c-betting can force opponents to surrender the pot and can be a profitable move for the player even without a strong hand.</p>
<h4>C-bet to…Get people out of the pot</h4>
<p>C-betting in poker can be particularly useful in multiway pots where more players are involved in the hand. By betting on the flop, a player can gain information about the strength of their opponents&#039; hands and potentially force weaker hands to fold. </p>
<p>Additionally, c-betting can thin out the field and reduce the number of opponents who remain in the hand, making it easier for the player to control the pot and potentially win with a weaker hand. </p>
<h4>C-bet to…Build the pot</h4><p>  </p>
<p>C-betting in poker is often better for getting value than slow-playing strong hands because it puts pressure on opponents to make decisions with incomplete information about the strength of a player&#039;s hand. </p>
<p>Slow playing a strong hand, on the other hand, can give opponents the opportunity to catch up and potentially outdraw the player. By c-betting, a player can extract more value from their opponents, even if they do not have a strong hand, and potentially win a larger pot in the process.</p>
<p>Five Super Tips to Help Poker Players Deal with Variance and Downswings</p>
<h3>When shouldn’t you C-bet?</h3>
<p>A player should avoid c-betting in poker when they have a weak hand, and multiple opponents are in the pot, as this can result in losing more chips than necessary. Additionally, c-betting should not be done predictably, as opponents can catch on and counter this strategy.</p>
<h4>Don’t c-bet when…you’re facing multiple opponents</h4>
<p>C-betting in poker can be risky when facing multiple opponents as it increases the chances of someone having a stronger hand. Betting with a weak hand in this situation can lead to unnecessarily losing more chips, as opponents are likelier to call or raise with a wider range of hands. </p>
<p>In such cases, it may be better to check and evaluate the situation before making any further decisions. Checking can also help a player to save chips and avoid getting trapped in a potentially losing hand.</p>
<h4>Don’t c-bet when…the flop hits your opponent&#039;s range more than yours</h4>
<p>When the flop hits an opponent&#039;s range more than a player&#039;s range, it may not be advisable to c-bet in poker. If an opponent has a wider range of strong hands on the flop than the player does, betting can lead to the player being called or raised with a stronger hand. </p>
<p>It may be better to check and potentially fold to any bets from the opponent. It is important for a player to accurately assess the strength of their own hand and their opponent&#039;s range before making any decisions. </p>
<h4>Don’t c-bet when…you’re out of position</h4>
<p>C-betting in poker when out of position can be risky, as it gives opponents the opportunity to take control of the hand. When a player is out of position, they will act before their opponents on subsequent betting rounds, potentially giving away valuable information about their hand.  </p>
<p>C-betting out of position can lead to larger bets from opponents, making it more difficult for the player to control the pot. In these spots, it may be better to check and evaluate the situation before making any further decisions.</p>
<h4>Don’t c-bet when…you’re facing a calling station</h4>
<p>When facing a calling station in poker, it may not be advisable to c-bet as these opponents are likelier to call with a wide range of hands. </p>
<p>Betting in such situations can lead to losing more chips unnecessarily, as calling stations are not easily intimidated and can be difficult to bluff. In these cases, it may be better to check and potentially call down on subsequent streets if the opponent bets. </p>
<p>It is important to adjust one&#039;s strategy based on the opponent&#039;s tendencies and play accordingly.</p>
<h4>Don’t c-bet when…you’re too far ahead</h4><p> </p>
<p>When a player flops the nuts in poker, it may not be advisable to c-bet, as this can scare off opponents and limit the potential size of the pot. Opponents with weaker hands may be more likely to fold to a bet rather than call or raise. </p>
<p>It may be better to slow play the hand and potentially induce bluffs or additional bets from opponents. This can help to build the pot and potentially win a larger amount of chips in the long run.</p>
<h3>How Much Should You Bet When You Are C-betting?</h3>
<p>When c-betting in poker, the bet size should be determined by the situation and board texture. A typical c-bet is usually between a third to 50% of the pot size, although different sizes can be used depending on the board texture. </p>
<p>A larger bet size may be more effective on a wet board where there are many possible draws, as it can discourage opponents from chasing their draws. Conversely, a smaller bet size may be more effective on a dry board with fewer draws, as it allows a player to extract value from weaker hands while minimizing their risk. </p>
<p>It is important to consider the board texture and opponent tendencies before deciding on a bet size when c-betting in poker.</p>
<h3>Can You C-bet on the Turn?</h3>
<p>Yes, a player can c-bet the turn in poker, which is commonly known as a double-barrel. Double-barrelling can be a useful strategy for building the pot and potentially winning more chips. It can also be effective when the opponent has shown weakness on the flop and may be more likely to fold to a second bet on the turn. </p>
<p>However, it is important to carefully evaluate the situation and the opponent&#039;s tendencies before making a double-barrelling play. If the opponent has shown strength or is likely to call another bet, it may be more effective to check and evaluate the situation before making any further decisions.</p>

<a name='name.238'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Cooler</h2>
<p>Used to describe a &quot;bad luck&quot; hand in which a player with a strong hand unfortunately clashes with an opponent holding something even better. In hold’em, getting all in preflop with pocket kings only to run into pocket aces is a common example of a &quot;cooler.&quot;</p>
<p>The term derives from the term &quot;cold deck,&quot; a reference to a deck that has been stacked by a cheater to produce certain hands when dealt resulting in a big loss to cheater’s intended victim (e.g., aces versus kings). Such a prepared deck would be introduced into the game and thus would the cards be cold to the touch when compared to the cards already in play. </p>
<p>Today a &quot;cooler&quot; doesn’t usually refer to a player being cheated, but feeling similarly after having experienced a hand in which he or she could not avoid losing.</p>

<a name='name.239'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Coordinated</h2>
<p>An adjective used in hold’em or Omaha to describe community cards that make a straight and/or flush possible (see “Wet Board”). Can also describe cards in one’s hand similarly “working together” in order to create extra possibilities when drawing. Regarding the latter, in Omaha it is often advised to play “coordinated” starting hands; e.g, in PLO <q class='c'>A</q><q class='d'>K</q><q class='c'>J</q><q class='d'>T</q> is a much stronger starting hand than <q class='c'>A</q><q class='d'>K</q><q class='h'>J</q><q class='s'>6</q> because the four cards are better coordinated.</p>

<a name='name.240'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Counterfeit</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;Counterfeit&quot; refers to a situation where the board cards nullify the value of a player&#039;s hand because the board itself contains a higher version of the same hand.</p>
<h3>Understanding Counterfeit in Poker </h3>
<p>In the world of <b>poker</b>, <b>Counterfeit</b> is a term used to describe a situation where the community cards, or the board, render a player&#039;s hand less valuable or even worthless because the board itself has a higher version of the same hand. This term is common across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and can occur in both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>Counterfeiting usually happens to players holding two-pair hands or bottom set, where the board pairs a higher card, making their lower pair or set less valuable.</p>
<h3>Examples of Counterfeit in Poker </h3>
<p>To better understand the concept of <b>Counterfeit</b> in poker, consider these examples:<br/>
In a game of Texas Hold&#039;em, you hold a 5 and a 6, and the flop comes up 5, 7, and 8. You have a pair of fives. If the turn and the river bring another 7 and 8, your hand is counterfeited by the higher two pair on the board.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, you hold a pair of 2s, and the board shows another 2, a 7, and an 8. You have three of a kind. However, if the turn and the river reveal another 7 and 8, your set is counterfeited by the higher full house on the board.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He thought he had a winning hand, but the river card counterfeited his two pairs.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She was ahead until her set got counterfeited by the turn and river cards.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The last community card counterfeited his hand, leaving him with nothing.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.248'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Crying Call</h2>
<p>In poker, a &quot;crying call&quot; is a term used to describe a situation where a player makes a call while believing they are likely to lose. It&#039;s a term commonly used in both live and online poker games, across all game types including cash games and tournaments.</p>
<h3>What is a Crying Call in Poker?</h3>
<p>A crying call in poker is a term that refers to a reluctant call made by a player who believes they are likely to lose the hand, but feels compelled to call due to the size of the pot or the betting action.</p>
<p>Making a crying call can be a part of <b>poker strategy</b>, but it often indicates a difficult or uncomfortable decision for the player. It&#039;s a term that&#039;s used across different <b>poker variants</b>, in both online and live settings, and in both tournaments and cash games.</p>
<h3>When to Make a Crying Call in Poker</h3>
<p>A crying call in poker is typically made when the pot odds justify calling a bet, even though the player believes they are likely to lose. This situation often arises when the pot is large and the cost of the call is relatively small.</p>
<p>However, making a crying call is generally not an ideal situation. It indicates that the player is in a tough spot, and is unsure about the strength of their hand compared to their opponents&#039;. Understanding when to make a crying call and when to fold can be an important part of <b>poker strategy</b> and <b>decision-making</b>.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Crying Call&quot;</h3>
<p>An example of a crying call could be in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em where you&#039;re holding a low pair and your opponent makes a large bet on the river. You&#039;re not confident in the strength of your hand, but the size of the pot makes it hard for you to fold. With reluctance, you decide to make a &quot;crying call&quot;.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;I wasn&#039;t sure if my pair was good, but the pot was so big that I had to make a crying call.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He made a crying call with his low pair and ended up losing to a straight.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She didn&#039;t seem confident when she called my bet, it looked like a crying call.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.255'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Cutoff</h2>
<p>In poker, &quot;Cutoff&quot; refers to the position directly to the right of the dealer or button. It is the second-best position in a hand of poker, as the player in the cutoff position acts second to last and has the advantage of seeing most of the other players&#039; actions before deciding their own.</p>
<h3>The Role of Cutoff in Poker </h3>
<p>In <b>poker</b>, the <b>Cutoff</b> is a term used to describe the position immediately to the right of the dealer or button. This term is used across all poker variants, including <b>Texas Hold&#039;em</b>, Omaha, and others, and applies to both <b>cash games</b> and <b>tournaments</b>.</p>
<p>The cutoff position is strategically important because it allows the player to observe the actions of most other players before making their own decision. This position also has the potential advantage of being the last to act post-flop if the dealer decides to fold pre-flop.</p>
<h3>Examples of Cutoff in Poker </h3>
<p>Here are some scenarios to illustrate the concept of <b>Cutoff</b> in poker:<br/>
In a Texas Hold&#039;em game, you&#039;re in the cutoff position. The players in the early and middle positions all fold. You decide to raise, trying to steal the blinds.</p>
<p>In an Omaha tournament, you&#039;re in the cutoff position. You have a decent hand and decide to call, hoping the dealer and blinds will fold.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to raise from the cutoff, hoping to steal the blinds.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She played aggressively from the cutoff, taking advantage of her late position.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Being in the cutoff gave him the chance to observe the other players&#039; actions before making his own.&quot;</li></ul>
