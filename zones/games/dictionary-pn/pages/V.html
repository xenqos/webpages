<a name='name.899'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Vaca</h2>
<p>Cow; usually preceded by la.</p>
<div><b>Usage:</b> <p>If a player says &quot;Vaca vaca&quot; to a floor person (or another player), it generally means, &quot;Do you want to go half and half with me in this game?&quot;</p></div>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.900'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Valet</h2>
<p>Jack (the card); comes from French.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.901'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Valle Card</h2>
<p>Any 3, 5, or 7; comes from the game of panguingue, in which those cards have value (which is the meaning of the word valle) and for which other players pay a player who melds them.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.902'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Value</h2>
<p>As in &quot;bet for value&quot;. This means that you would actually like your opponents to call your bet (as opposed to a bluff). Generally it's because you have the best hand. However, it can also be a draw which, given enough callers, has a positive expectation. </p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.903'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Value Bet</h2>
<p>A bet made “for value.” This means that the person doing the betting <i>wants</i> the opponent to call the bet, unlike in the case of a bluff when the player betting desires a fold.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.904'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Variance</h2>
<p>&#039;Variance&#039; in poker refers to the statistical measure of how your results will vary from the mean or expected outcome over a specified period.</p>
<h3>What is Variance in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Variance&#039; is a statistical term used to describe the degree by which your actual results will differ from the expected ones over a certain period. High variance implies a greater range of outcomes (both positive and negative), while low variance suggests more consistent, but possibly lower, returns.</p>
<h3>Understanding Variance </h3>
<p>Variance is a natural part of poker due to the game&#039;s inherent uncertainty. Even the best players with a positive win rate can experience losing streaks due to variance. Understanding and managing variance is a crucial part of long-term poker strategy.</p>
<h3>Dealing with Variance </h3>
<p>One common method to deal with variance is bankroll management. By ensuring you have enough funds to weather potential downswings, you can keep playing optimally without the fear of going broke.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Variance&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, a player who often takes big risks for high rewards will likely experience high variance, with significant wins but also potentially large losses.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite his solid strategy, he hit a rough patch of variance and had a losing month.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Her conservative style leads to lower variance, but she consistently makes a profit.&quot;</li><li>&quot;He decided to play in higher stakes games, accepting the increased variance for the chance at larger payouts.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.908'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Victory Rip</h2>
<p>1) In a draw game, at the showdown, spreading your hand triumphantly. (It's usually done in the same manner that a blackjack or poker dealer spreads an entire deck fanned face up on the table in front of her. Spreading one's hand in this fashion, by the way, is something of a needle, and is not practiced by a refined player, who, when he has an obvious powerhouse, gently and diffidently turns it face up on the table.) <br/>
2) A similar method of showing down in any form of poker.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.909'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Victory Roll</h2>

<a name='name.911'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Video Poker Machine</h2>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.912'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Vigorish</h2>
<p>House take; time; rake.</p>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.914'>&nbsp;</a><h2>VPIP</h2>
<p>&#039;VPIP&#039; in poker stands for &#039;Voluntarily Put money In Pot&#039;, a statistical measure used in poker tracking software to show the percentage of hands in which a particular player voluntarily puts money into the pot preflop.</p>
<h3>What is VPIP in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;VPIP&#039; stands for &#039;Voluntarily Put money In Pot&#039;. It is a statistical measure used in poker tracking software to quantify the percentage of hands in which a particular player voluntarily puts money into the pot preflop. This can include any situation where a player calls, bets, or raises, but it excludes instances where a player is forced to put money in the pot, such as posting blinds or antes.</p>
<h3>Understanding VPIP </h3>
<p>VPIP is a commonly used statistic in online poker to help players understand the playing style of their opponents. A higher VPIP percentage indicates a player who plays more hands, while a lower VPIP percentage indicates a player who plays fewer hands.</p>
<p>For example, a player with a VPIP of 10% only voluntarily puts money into the pot in 10% of hands, indicating a very selective and tight player. On the other hand, a player with a VPIP of 50% plays half of their hands, indicating a very loose player.</p>
<h3>Using VPIP in Your Strategy </h3>
<p>Understanding your own VPIP, as well as that of your opponents, can be very useful in developing a successful poker strategy. By knowing how often your opponents are likely to play hands, you can adjust your own betting strategy to exploit their tendencies.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;VPIP&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing online poker and you notice that a certain player has a VPIP of 70%, you can infer that they play very loose and are likely to play with many weak hands.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He noticed that his opponent had a high VPIP, indicating a loose playing style.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Her low VPIP suggested that she played very selectively and only entered the pot with strong hands.&quot;</li><li>&quot;By understanding VPIP, he was able to adjust his strategy to exploit the tendencies of his opponents.&quot;</li></ul>
