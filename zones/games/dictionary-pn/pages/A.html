<a name='name.001'>&nbsp;</a><h2>A-Game</h2>
<p>A-Game is a term used in poker to describe playing at your highest level or best ability. It represents the pinnacle of your skill, strategy, and concentration. It refers to the best ability you can bring to the poker table, regardless of the variant you&#039;re playing or whether it&#039;s online or live, tournament or cash game.</p>
<h3>Understanding A-Game</h3>
<p>In poker, your <b>A-Game</b> represents the <b>best version of your poker play</b>. This is a state where you&#039;re fully focused, making the best decisions, and utilizing your <b>poker strategies</b> and skills to their utmost potential. The term is not limited to a specific type of poker, but can be applied to all variants, including Texas Hold&#039;em, Omaha, Seven-Card Stud, etc.</p>
<p>Your A-Game is influenced by a variety of factors, including your emotional state, physical health, and level of fatigue. It&#039;s important to be in the right mindset and in good health to bring your A-Game to the poker table.</p>
<h3>Achieving Your A-Game</h3>
<p>Delivering your <b>A-Game</b> consistently is a major challenge that requires a comprehensive understanding of a game&#039;s rules, a well-developed <b>poker strategy</b>, and the ability to make optimal decisions under pressure.</p>
<p>It also means managing your <b>emotions</b>, avoiding <b>tilt</b>, and being able to adapt to changing conditions in the game. It&#039;s about maintaining a high level of performance over extended periods of time, which often involves managing your energy levels and taking care of your physical health.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;A-Game&quot; in Poker</h3>
<p>While it&#039;s difficult to come up with a specific example, someone could be considered to be playing their &quot;A-Game&quot; if they won a particularly hand that required precise reads on their opponents, or made optimal decisions at every point in a hand due to their superior poker knowledge.</p>
<p>Players who play their A-Game stay focused on their strategy and adjust their play based on the game&#039;s dynamics.</p>
<p>Another example could be a player who is physically tired or emotionally drained, but manages to keep their concentration and decision-making abilities at peak level, thus maintaining their A-Game despite adverse conditions.</p>
<p>Examples of using the term &quot;A-Game&quot; in a sentence:</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Despite being down to his last few chips, John managed to bring his A-Game and claw his way back to victory.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Sarah always brings her A-Game to the poker table, which makes her a tough opponent.&quot;</li><li>&quot;If you want to win at poker consistently, you need to bring your A-Game every time you sit at the table.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.019'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Action</h2>
<p>The term &quot;Action&quot; in poker refers to the player&#039;s turn to make a decision in the game. When it&#039;s a player&#039;s turn to act, we say that &quot;the action is on them&quot;. The decisions they can then make include calling, raising, checking, betting, or folding.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In poker, the game moves in a clockwise direction, with the action following this movement. Each player, when their turn comes, must decide what to do based on the state of the game, their hand, and their strategy. This then changes the state of the game and influences the decisions of the other players.</p>
<h3>Action and Betting Rounds</h3>
<p>In every betting round, from the pre-flop stage to the river, each player will have a turn or action. The player to the left of the dealer usually starts and it continues in a clockwise direction until all players have had their turn or &quot;acted&quot; in the hand. If a player makes a bet or a raise, the action will continue until it reaches the player who made the last raise.</p>
<h3>Example of Action in Poker</h3>
<p>For example, in a game of Texas Hold&#039;em with 5 players, let&#039;s say you&#039;re the third player. The first player folds, the second player bets $10. Now the action is on you. You can decide to call the $10, raise the bet, or fold.</p>
<p>In another example, if you have a strong hand, you might decide to raise when the action comes to you in an attempt to force the other players to fold.</p>
<p>Examples of using the term &#039;action&#039; in a sentence:</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The action is on you, what&#039;s your decision?&quot;</li><li>&quot;When the action came to me, I decided to raise.&quot;</li><li>&quot;I was waiting for the action to come around to see what the other players would do.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.020'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Action Button</h2>
<p>A bet that must be posted by the winner of a scoop pot above a certain size in a seven-card stud high-low game. The bet signifies a full bet (i.e., a blind raise), rather than just a call of the original forced bet (i.e., the bring-in). </p>
<p>Any player who acts before the action button can only call the bring-in. The holder of the action button essentially raises blind, and then, when it gets back to those who have only so far called the opening bet, they can either call or raise. </p>
<p>&quot;Action buttons&quot; can also refer to clickable buttons or boxes in online poker able to be selected in advance of a player's turn.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.021'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Action Only</h2>
<p>In many card rooms, with respect to an all-in bet, only a full bet is considered a legitimate wager constituting a raise that can be reraised. In other words, anything less than a full bet is considered &quot;action only,&quot; meaning other players can call such a bet but not raise it. </p>
<p>For example, Chloe bets $10 and Henry calls, then John goes all in for $14. When the bet gets back to Chloe, she is permitted only to call the extra $4, and the same goes for John.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.022'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Active Player</h2>
<p>Any player who is still in the hand.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.023'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Add-on</h2>
<p>A purchase of more chips (optional) at the end of the rebuy period in a tournament.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.024'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Advantage</h2>
<p>A synonym for &quot;edge&quot; that can refer to a player being better-skilled, holding a stronger hand, or having an favorable position. See also &quot;advantage player.&quot;</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.025'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Advantage Player</h2>
<p>A term that can be used generically to refer to any player seeking an advantage in a game. More specifically, the term is often used with reference to players of casino games who seek flaws or errors in the games in order to gain an edge.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.026'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Advantage Tool</h2>
<p>Any device or method employed to cheat such as a marked card or a mechanical device for hiding one or more cards (e.g., a holdout machine).</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.027'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Advertise</h2>
<p>To make a bluff with the deliberate intention of being exposed as a loose player. Advertising usually means showing down a mediocre hand in order to give the impression that you play overly loose or that you play a generally weak game. The idea is that other players will then give you more action when you make a legitimate hand. Since people are bad at revising first impressions, this potentially beneficial effect can be long-lasting. </p>
<p>Advertising can also mean anything you do at the poker table to manipulate how other players assess you.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.028'>&nbsp;</a><h2>After-Hours Game</h2>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.030'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Agent</h2>
<p>A generic term referring to someone colluding with one or more cheaters. An &quot;agent&quot; might partner with other players in a cheating scheme, or with casino dealers and employees in an effort to cheat. An &quot;agent&quot; might also be the person luring another player into a crooked game where that player will be cheated.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.031'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Aggression</h2>
<p>Aggression, in poker, refers to the tendency of a player to bet and raise rather than check or just call. An aggressive player will typically make more bets and raises than a passive player, and often uses this strategy to pressure their opponents.</p>
<h3>Understanding Aggression in Poker </h3>
<p>In poker, aggression is a crucial tactic that can often lead to success. An aggressive strategy often puts pressure on opponents and may cause them to make mistakes. An aggressive player will often try to control the pot and dictate the pace of the game.</p>
<h3>The Role of Aggression in Different Game Situations </h3>
<p>Aggression can be used strategically in various game situations. For instance, in early positions in a round of betting, aggressive play can be a show of strength and can help to thin the field of players. </p>
<p>In later positions, it can be used to build the pot when you have a strong hand, or to bluff when you have a weak hand. Aggression can also be used to exploit tight players who tend to fold under pressure.</p>
<h3>Examples of &quot;Aggression&quot; in Poker </h3>
<ul><li>A player in late position with a strong hand such as A-K might raise to get other players to fold, demonstrating aggression.</li><li>A player with a mediocre hand might make a large bet to try to scare off opponents, again showing aggression.</li><li>An aggressive player might consistently raise in early position to try to control the pot.</li></ul>
<p>Some example sentences using the term &quot;Aggression&quot;</p>
<ul><li>&quot;John&#039;s <b>aggression</b> in the late stages of the game helped him build a substantial pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Sarah used <i>aggression</i> to bluff her opponents into folding, even though she had a weak hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Mike&#039;s lack of <b>aggression</b> allowed his opponents to control the game.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.032'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Aggressive</h2>
<p>A playing style marked by a tendency to bet or raise more often than to check or call (as someone playing a &quot;passive&quot; style might do). </p>
<p>Not to be confused with a &quot;loose&quot; style which involves playing a higher frequency of hands, relatively speaking. That is to say, a player can be &quot;loose-agressive&quot; (playing lots of hands and betting/raising frequently) or &quot;tight-aggressive&quot; (playing fewer hands but also betting/raising frequently).</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>

<p>Air</p>
<p>Generally refers to a &quot;nothing&quot; hand or a hand with zero value, as in &quot;I bluffed him with total air and won.&quot;</p>
<p>The term also is used sometimes in lowball drawing games (e.g., deuce-to-seven triple draw) when letting an opponent know on a given betting round one's intentions on the next draw, wherein &quot;giving air&quot; means indicating an intention to draw cards in order to get an opponent to stay in a hand. &quot;He was going to fold, but I was giving air that I would be drawing two and so he called.&quot;</p>

<a name='name.042'>&nbsp;</a><h2>All In</h2>
<h3>All In in Poker </h3>
<p>When a player goes &quot;All In&quot; in poker, they are betting all of their remaining chips on a single hand. This move can be both exciting and risky, and it is often used as a last resort when a player believes they have a strong hand but do not have enough chips to make a standard bet.</p>
<p>It can also be used as a final method to build a pot, especially when a player is holding an unbeatable hand (the nuts).</p>
<h4>How to Go All In in Poker </h4>
<p>To go &quot;All In&quot; in poker, a player must push all of their remaining chips towards the center of the table or simply declare their intention to go all in. Once a player is all in, they cannot make any further bets in the hand, and they are only eligible to win the portion of the pot that they contributed to before going all in.</p>
<p>Going all in can be a powerful move that puts pressure on your opponents to make tough decisions, but it can also be a risky strategy that can lead to losing all of your chips in a single hand.</p>
<h4>Situations Where Going All In is Common </h4>
<p>Going all in is most common in No Limit Texas Hold&#039;em, where players can bet any amount of chips they have in front of them. Some common situations where going all in might be a good strategy include:</p>
<ul><li><b>When you have a strong hand</b>: If you have a hand that you believe is the strongest at the table, going all in can help you maximize your potential winnings.</li><li><b>When you are short-stacked</b>: If you have a small number of chips left and are at risk of being blinded out, going all in can help you stay in the game.</li><li><b>When you want to bluff</b>: Going all in as a bluff can be an effective way to make your opponents fold their hands.</li></ul>
<h4>Examples of Going &#039;All in&#039; in Poker </h4>
<p><b>Situation 1:</b> It&#039;s the final table of a poker tournament, and you are in the top three chip stacks. The player in first position goes all in pre-flop, and you have a strong hand with pocket Kings. You decide to go all in as well, forcing the third opponent out. Your hand holds up, giving you a significant chip lead going into the heads-up portion of the tournament.</p>
<p><b>Situation 2:</b> You are playing in a cash game, and you have been getting unlucky with your hands all night. You are down to your last few chips and are dealt pocket Aces. You decide to go all in pre-flop, hoping to double up and get back in the game. Unfortunately, one of your opponents has pocket Kings and calls your bet. They hit their king and you are eliminated from the game.</p>
<p><b>Situation 3:</b> You are playing in a heads-up game of No Limit Hold&#039;em, and your opponent has been playing very aggressively. During a hand, you decide to go all in as a bluff, hoping to scare your opponent into folding. Your opponent calls your bet and reveals a strong hand, and you lose the hand and all of your chips.</p>
<h4>Poker Term All In in Poker FAQS </h4>
<p>[FAQ]<br/>
Q: What does it mean to go all in in poker?<br/>
A: Going all in in poker means betting all of your remaining chips on a single hand.</p>
<p>Q: Is going all in a good strategy in poker?<br/>
A: Going all in can be a good strategy in certain situations, such as when you have a strong hand or are short-stacked, but it can also be a risky move that can lead to losing all of your chips in a single hand.</p>
<p>Q: Can you be forced to go all in in poker?<br/>
A: No, players cannot be forced to go all in in poker. Going all in is a voluntary move that a player makes when they choose to bet all of their remaining chips. The only exception to this is if a player is in the big or small blind, or must pay an ante, but they don&#039;t have enough chips to pay the blinds or ante in full. In this instance, they are forced all in for their remaining chips.</p>
<p>Q: What happens if two players go all in?<br/>
A: If two players go all in, then the one with the least amount of chips will be at risk of being eliminated (if it&#039;s a tournament) and losing their entire stack.</p>
<p>Q: Can you raise when a player goes all in?<br/>
A: In most poker variants, you can raise when a player goes all in. However, the raise must equal the lowest allowed bet. For instance, if blinds are 5,000/10,000 and a player goes all in for 15,000, you cannot then raise to 16,000.</p>

<p>An action that isn't against the rules, but still incorporates unfair tactics. Such a maneuver is usually on the border between legality and illegality, though is clearly unethical and performed to take unfair advantage of another player.</p>
<p>Angle is short for Angle Shooting.</p>
<p>The Tournament Director Association (TDA) has formed many new rules in recent year to combat specific angles. Especially the verbal declaration rule that was misused by many angle shooters (players performing an angle) has been made more specific. </p>
<p>An angle isn't illegal, but many tournament directors take a stance when they suspect a player is trying to pull an angle on another player at the table. Often, the first time a player is given a warning. More severe penalties are introduced when the same or other angles occur by the same player.</p>

<a name='name.057'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Angle Shooting</h2>
<p>Angle Shooting is a controversial tactic often used in poker where a player attempts to bend the rules to gain an advantage. It&#039;s not explicitly cheating but is generally viewed as unethical or unsportsmanlike behavior in the poker community.</p>
<h3>Understanding Angle Shooting in Poker </h3>
<p>Angle shooting is a tactic that walks the fine line between cheating and gamesmanship. </p>
<p>Angle shooters use a variety of techniques to gain an edge, such as misleading statements about their hand, intentionally misplaying a hand, or exploiting a rule ambiguity. It’s important for all players to be aware of these tactics, as they can be used against you.</p>
<p>It is important to note that angle shooting is not technically against the rules, as it does not involve actual cheating or breaking any rules. However, it is considered unethical because it abuses the spirit of the game.</p>
<h3>Example of Angle Shooting in Poker</h3>
<p>One common example of angle shooting is the &quot;slow roll.&quot; In this case, a player with a winning hand delays revealing their cards in order to create a false sense of hope in their opponent. This can unsettle opponents and lead to them making poor decisions in future hands.</p>
<p>Another example is when a player makes a bet but intentionally doesn&#039;t put enough chips into the pot, pretending it was a mistake. This can cause confusion and lead to their opponent making a decision based on incorrect information.</p>
<p>A player might also use ambiguous wording when declaring their actions to mislead their opponents. For example, they might say &quot;I call... and raise&quot; which can confuse opponents and lead them to react in a way that benefits the angle shooter.</p>
<p>Here are some sentences using the term angle shooting:</p>
<ul><li>&quot;Watch out for Bob, he&#039;s known for angle shooting.&quot;</li><li>&quot;I can&#039;t believe he tried to pull an angle in the last hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;That was a clear case of angle shooting, he intentionally misled us about his bet.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.059'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Announce</h2>

<a name='name.060'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Announced Bet</h2>
<p>A verbal declaration by a player, made in turn in a no-limit or spread game, of the amount of his bet, or, in other games, that he is betting. In games in which announced bets are permitted, they are usually binding (when made in turn).</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.061'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Ante</h2>
<p>The term &quot;ante&quot; refers to a forced bet that all players must place before the cards are dealt. It&#039;s a way to ensure there&#039;s always a minimum amount of money in the pot for players to win.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Ante </h3>
<p>The ante is a crucial part of the betting structure in some poker games, particularly in tournament play. Unlike blinds, which are paid only by two players, the ante is paid by every player at the table. The ante is usually a small amount, often just a fraction of the minimum bet. However, its presence in the pot can significantly influence a player&#039;s strategy.</p>
<p>Although many No-Limit Hold&#039;em tournaments no longer utilize antes, they are still prevalent in mixed game tournaments, bomb pots and short deck tournaments. </p>
<p>The main purpose of the ante is to stimulate action by creating an initial pot. This encourages players to compete for the pot rather than folding their hands pre-flop. It essentially forces players to participate more actively in the game, which can result in more exciting gameplay.</p>
<h3>Ante in Different Poker Variants </h3>
<p>The use of an ante varies depending on the poker variant. In Texas Hold&#039;em, the ante is typically used in the later stages of tournament play. In Stud poker, there is usually an ante in every hand. In Pot-Limit Omaha, the use of an ante is less common but can still occur in certain situations.</p>
<p>Some poker variants, like No-Limit Hold&#039;em, might introduce an ante only in the later stages of a tournament. In cash games, antes are less common but can be found in some high-stakes games to stimulate action.</p>
<h3>Example of Antes in Poker </h3>
<p>Let&#039;s consider a Texas Hold&#039;em poker tournament with 9 players. The tournament rules state that there is a 100 chip ante after the first hour. This means that before each hand is dealt, every player must contribute 100 chips to the pot. So, before the cards are even dealt, there are 900 chips in the pot.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The ante is $5, so everyone please put your chips in the pot.&quot;</li><li>&quot;As the tournament progresses, the ante increases to keep the game moving.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Even though I had a weak hand, the size of the pot due to the ante tempted me to stay in the game.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.062'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Ante and Straddle</h2>
<p>A game in which the player to the left of the dealer (the ante) puts in (usually) one chip before getting any cards, and the player to his left (the straddle) puts in two chips. (Sometimes the dealer also puts in one chip.) The first player to have a choice on making a bet after having seen his cards is the player two positions to the left of the dealer. This is an old name for what is now called a two-blind traveling blind game. This is similar to a blind and straddle game. Also see little blind, middle blind, big blind.</p>
