# Bet Sizes 2

### 1. **Standard Open Raises (2-3 BB)**
- **Pot Size:** Before the raise, the pot is typically around 2-3 BB.
- **Percentage of Pot:** A raise of 2-3 BB is about 100% to 150% of the pot.
- **Reaction:** This is a standard open raise. You can call with a wide range of hands, especially in late position. If you have a strong hand, consider 3-betting to around 3-5 BB (150%-250% of the original raise).

### 2. **Small Raises (1-2 BB)**
- **Pot Size:** The pot is still small, around 2-3 BB.
- **Percentage of Pot:** A raise of 1-2 BB is about 50% to 100% of the pot.
- **Reaction:** This small raise often indicates weakness or a steal attempt. You can call with a wider range of hands or 3-bet as a bluff. If you call, you’re investing a small amount relative to the pot.

### 3. **Large Raises (4-5 BB)**
- **Pot Size:** The pot is now around 4-6 BB.
- **Percentage of Pot:** A raise of 4-5 BB is about 66% to 125% of the pot.
- **Reaction:** This indicates strength. You should tighten your calling range and consider 3-betting with strong hands. If you call, be prepared to play a larger pot post-flop.

### 4. **Very Large Raises (6 BB or more)**
- **Pot Size:** The pot is now around 6-8 BB or more.
- **Percentage of Pot:** A raise of 6 BB is about 75% to 100% of the pot.
- **Reaction:** A raise of this size usually indicates a strong hand. Be very selective about calling. Only continue with premium hands, and consider folding weaker holdings. If you have a strong hand, you might consider a 3-bet to around 2-3 times the raise (which would be a significant percentage of the pot).

### 5. **All-In Bets**
- **Pot Size:** The pot size can vary significantly.
- **Percentage of Pot:** An all-in bet can represent a large percentage of the pot, often 100% or more.
- **Reaction:** Assess your hand strength and the pot odds. If the pot is large relative to the all-in bet, it may be profitable to call with a wider range. If the pot is small, be more cautious.

### 6. **Re-Raises (3-Betting)**
- **Pot Size:** The pot size increases with each raise.
- **Percentage of Pot:** A 3-bet can be anywhere from 150% to 300% of the original raise, depending on the size.
- **Reaction:** If facing a 3-bet, consider the size of the pot and your hand strength. If the 3-bet is large relative to the pot, tighten your calling range. If the pot is large and you have a strong hand, you might consider a 4-bet.

### 7. **Multi-Way Pots**
- **Pot Size:** The pot grows larger with more players.
- **Percentage of Pot:** The percentage of the pot represented by a bet can vary widely.
- **Reaction:** In multi-way pots, be more cautious with your calling range, especially against larger bets. The more players in the pot, the stronger your hand needs to be to continue.
