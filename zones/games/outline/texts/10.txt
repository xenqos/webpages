## Voluntary Put Money in the Pot - VPIP
When a player enters the pot by either calling or raising. Posting the blinds does not count as VPIP because the blinds are forced (not voluntary) bets.

## Two-bet (2-bet or 2b)
The blinds are considered as the “First Bet”, then the first person to raise the pot is making a “Second Bet” or “Two Bet”; RFI is a special case of 2bet when there are no limpers.

## Three Bet (3-bet or 3b)
Making a re-raise, which is to increase the bet after someone else raised.

## Four-bet (4-bet or 4b), 5-bet and any subsequent number of bets
Refers to the number of bets that have been made during the current betting round.

## Steal
Raise First In from BN, CO or SB.

## Resteal
3-betting after someone else steals.

## Isolate
Raising after someone has entered the pot with the intention of playing heads-up post-flop vs that player.

## Minraise
When a player raises the minimum allowed, which is two times the last bet amount.

## Minbet
Making the minimum bet allowed. Post-flop, this is one big blind.

## Overbet
Making a bet that is larger than the size of the pot.

## Open Shove or Open Jam
Going all-in when no one else has entered the pot before you.

## 3-bet-Jam, 3-bet-Shove, Reshove, or Rejam
Moving all-in after someone else has already raised.

## Cold 4-bet
4-betting when the player making the 4-bet was not the initial raiser. For example: UTG opens to 2bb, BN 3-bets to 5bb and the BB cold 4-bets to 12.5bb.

## Cold Calling - CC
Calling a single raise when in position, or calling a 3-bet or 4-bet when you have not previously voluntarily put money in the pot. For example, MP opens to 2bb, CO 3-bets to 6bb, BN folds and SB cold calls.

## Squeeze - SQZ
3-betting after someone raised and someone else called. For example, UTG1 opens to 2bb, CO cold calls, BN squeezes to 9bb.

## Continuation Bet - C-bet
Post-flop bet made by the player who was the last aggressor in the previous betting round.

## Donk Bet or Lead Out - DK
When the player who is OOP bets into the aggressor on the previous betting round, denying the option to C-bet.

## Slow Play or Trap
To play a premium holding in a passive manner, hoping to induce a value-bet from an inferior hand or a bluff.
