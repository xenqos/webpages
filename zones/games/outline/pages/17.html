<h1>Bet Sizes</h1>

Reaction to different bet sizes is important important aspect of strategy.<br>

<h2>1. Standard Open Raises (2-3 BB)</h2>
<b>Reaction:</b> Call or 3-bet with a wide range of hands, depending on your position and the tendencies of the villain. In early position, you might want to be tighter, while in late position, you can widen your range.<br>

<h3>1. Standard Open Raises (2-3 BB)</h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> Typically, the pot is around 2-3 BB before the first raise.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> A raise of 2-3 BB is often seen as a standard open. You can call with a wide range of hands, especially in late position. If you have a strong hand, consider 3-betting to around 3-5 times the original raise.<br>

<h2>2. Small Raises (1-2 BB)</h2>
<b>Reaction:</b> These are often seen as &quot;steal&quot; attempts or weak opens. You can call with a wider range of hands or even consider a 3-bet bluff if you have a good read on the villain.<br>

<h3>2. <b>Small Raises (1-2 BB)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot is still small, often around 2-3 BB.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> A small raise (1-2 BB) is often a sign of weakness or a steal attempt. You can call with a wider range of hands or 3-bet as a bluff. If you call, you can expect to see a flop with a relatively small investment.<br>
<br>

<h2>3. Large Raises (4-5 BB or more)</h2>
<b>Reaction:</b> These indicate strength. You should tighten your calling range and consider 3-betting only with strong hands (e.g., premium pairs, strong suited connectors). If you have a read that the villain is overly aggressive, you might still consider calling with a wider range.<br>

<h3>3. <b>Large Raises (4-5 BB)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot is now around 4-6 BB.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> A raise of 4-5 BB indicates strength. You should tighten your calling range and consider 3-betting with strong hands. If you call, be prepared to play a larger pot post-flop.<br>

<h2>4. Very Large Raises (6 BB or more)</h2>
<b>Reaction:</b> These are often indicative of a strong hand. You should be very selective about calling or 3-betting. Generally, you should only continue with premium hands and consider folding weaker holdings.<br>

<h3>4. <b>Very Large Raises (6 BB or more)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot is now around 6-8 BB or more.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> A raise of this size usually indicates a strong hand. You should be very selective about calling. Only continue with premium hands, and consider folding weaker holdings. If you have a strong hand, you might consider a 3-bet to around 2-3 times the raise.<br>

<h2>5. All-In Bets</h2>
<b>Reaction:</b> If a player goes all-in, you need to assess your hand strength, the pot odds, and the player's tendencies. Call with strong hands, and consider folding marginal hands unless you have a strong read that the player is bluffing.<br>

<h3>5. <b>All-In Bets</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot size can vary significantly.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> If a player goes all-in, assess your hand strength and the pot odds. If the pot is large relative to the all-in bet, you may find it profitable to call with a wider range. However, if the pot is small, you should be more cautious.<br>

<h2>6. Re-Raises (3-Betting)</h2>
<b>Reaction:</b> If facing a 3-bet, your reaction should depend on your hand strength and the original raiser's tendencies. You can call with strong hands and consider 4-betting with premium hands or as a bluff against aggressive players.<br>

<h3>6. <b>Re-Raises (3-Betting)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot size increases with each raise.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> If facing a 3-bet, consider the size of the pot and your hand strength. If the 3-bet is large relative to the pot, you should tighten your calling range. If the pot is large and you have a strong hand, you might consider a 4-bet.<br>

<h2>7. Multi-Way Pots</h2>
<b>Reaction:</b> In multi-way pots, you should be more cautious with your calling range, especially against larger bets. The more players in the pot, the stronger your hand needs to be to continue.<br>

<h3>7. <b>Multi-Way Pots</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot grows larger with more players.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> In multi-way pots, be more cautious with your calling range, especially against larger bets. The more players in the pot, the stronger your hand needs to be to continue.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Additional Considerations:</h2>

<b>Stack Sizes:</b> Consider the effective stack sizes. Shorter stacks may be more likely to push all-in, while deeper stacks may allow for more post-flop play.<br>
<br>
- <b>Pot Odds:</b> Always calculate the pot odds when facing a bet. If the odds of winning the hand are greater than the odds being offered by the pot, it may be profitable to call.<br>
- <b>Implied Odds:</b> Consider the potential future bets you can win if you hit your hand. This is especially important in deep-stacked situations.<br>
