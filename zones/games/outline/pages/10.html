<h2>Voluntary Put Money in the Pot - VPIP</h2>
When a player enters the pot by either calling or raising. Posting the blinds does not count as VPIP because the blinds are forced (not voluntary) bets.<br>

<h2>Two-bet (2-bet or 2b)</h2>
The blinds are considered as the “First Bet”, then the first person to raise the pot is making a “Second Bet” or “Two Bet”; RFI is a special case of 2bet when there are no limpers.<br>

<h2>Three Bet (3-bet or 3b)</h2>
Making a re-raise, which is to increase the bet after someone else raised.<br>

<h2>Four-bet (4-bet or 4b), 5-bet and any subsequent number of bets</h2>
Refers to the number of bets that have been made during the current betting round.<br>

<h2>Steal</h2>
Raise First In from BN, CO or SB.<br>

<h2>Resteal</h2>
3-betting after someone else steals.<br>

<h2>Isolate</h2>
Raising after someone has entered the pot with the intention of playing heads-up post-flop vs that player.<br>

<h2>Minraise</h2>
When a player raises the minimum allowed, which is two times the last bet amount.<br>

<h2>Minbet</h2>
Making the minimum bet allowed. Post-flop, this is one big blind.<br>

<h2>Overbet</h2>
Making a bet that is larger than the size of the pot.<br>

<h2>Open Shove or Open Jam</h2>
Going all-in when no one else has entered the pot before you.<br>

<h2>3-bet-Jam, 3-bet-Shove, Reshove, or Rejam</h2>
Moving all-in after someone else has already raised.<br>

<h2>Cold 4-bet</h2>
4-betting when the player making the 4-bet was not the initial raiser. For example: UTG opens to 2bb, BN 3-bets to 5bb and the BB cold 4-bets to 12.5bb.<br>

<h2>Cold Calling - CC</h2>
Calling a single raise when in position, or calling a 3-bet or 4-bet when you have not previously voluntarily put money in the pot. For example, MP opens to 2bb, CO 3-bets to 6bb, BN folds and SB cold calls.<br>

<h2>Squeeze - SQZ</h2>
3-betting after someone raised and someone else called. For example, UTG1 opens to 2bb, CO cold calls, BN squeezes to 9bb.<br>

<h2>Continuation Bet - C-bet</h2>
Post-flop bet made by the player who was the last aggressor in the previous betting round.<br>

<h2>Donk Bet or Lead Out - DK</h2>
When the player who is OOP bets into the aggressor on the previous betting round, denying the option to C-bet.<br>

<h2>Slow Play or Trap</h2>
To play a premium holding in a passive manner, hoping to induce a value-bet from an inferior hand or a bluff.<br>
