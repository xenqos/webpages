<h1>Bet Sizes 2</h1>

<h3>1. <b>Standard Open Raises (2-3 BB)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> Before the raise, the pot is typically around 2-3 BB.<br>
- <b>Percentage of Pot:</b> A raise of 2-3 BB is about 100% to 150% of the pot.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> This is a standard open raise. You can call with a wide range of hands, especially in late position. If you have a strong hand, consider 3-betting to around 3-5 BB (150%-250% of the original raise).<br>

<h3>2. <b>Small Raises (1-2 BB)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot is still small, around 2-3 BB.<br>
- <b>Percentage of Pot:</b> A raise of 1-2 BB is about 50% to 100% of the pot.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> This small raise often indicates weakness or a steal attempt. You can call with a wider range of hands or 3-bet as a bluff. If you call, you’re investing a small amount relative to the pot.<br>

<h3>3. <b>Large Raises (4-5 BB)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot is now around 4-6 BB.<br>
- <b>Percentage of Pot:</b> A raise of 4-5 BB is about 66% to 125% of the pot.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> This indicates strength. You should tighten your calling range and consider 3-betting with strong hands. If you call, be prepared to play a larger pot post-flop.<br>

<h3>4. <b>Very Large Raises (6 BB or more)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot is now around 6-8 BB or more.<br>
- <b>Percentage of Pot:</b> A raise of 6 BB is about 75% to 100% of the pot.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> A raise of this size usually indicates a strong hand. Be very selective about calling. Only continue with premium hands, and consider folding weaker holdings. If you have a strong hand, you might consider a 3-bet to around 2-3 times the raise (which would be a significant percentage of the pot).<br>

<h3>5. <b>All-In Bets</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot size can vary significantly.<br>
- <b>Percentage of Pot:</b> An all-in bet can represent a large percentage of the pot, often 100% or more.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> Assess your hand strength and the pot odds. If the pot is large relative to the all-in bet, it may be profitable to call with a wider range. If the pot is small, be more cautious.<br>

<h3>6. <b>Re-Raises (3-Betting)</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot size increases with each raise.<br>
- <b>Percentage of Pot:</b> A 3-bet can be anywhere from 150% to 300% of the original raise, depending on the size.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> If facing a 3-bet, consider the size of the pot and your hand strength. If the 3-bet is large relative to the pot, tighten your calling range. If the pot is large and you have a strong hand, you might consider a 4-bet.<br>

<h3>7. <b>Multi-Way Pots</b></h3>
- <b>Pot Size:</b> The pot grows larger with more players.<br>
- <b>Percentage of Pot:</b> The percentage of the pot represented by a bet can vary widely.<br>
- <b>Reaction:</b> In multi-way pots, be more cautious with your calling range, especially against larger bets. The more players in the pot, the stronger your hand needs to be to continue.<br>
