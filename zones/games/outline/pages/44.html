Entering the pot by calling the minimum bet (1bb).<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Raise (r)</span><br>

<br>
<span class='m'>Check (x)</span><br>
The option to pass your turn. Pre-flop, it can only be done from the big blind if no one else raised. Post-flop, it can be done if you are first to act or if other players have checked to you.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Voluntary Put Money in the Pot (VPIP)</span><br>
When a player enters the pot by either calling or raising. Posting the blinds does not count as VPIP because the blinds are forced (not voluntary) bets.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Raise First In (RFI)</span><br>
When a player is first in and enters the pot by raising. Also referred to as open raising.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Two-bet (2-bet or 2b)</span><br>
The blinds are considered as the “First Bet”, then the first person to raise the pot is making a “Second Bet” or “Two Bet”; RFI is a special case of 2bet when there are no limpers.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Steal</span><br>
Raise First In from BN, CO or SB.<br>

<span class='m'>Minraise</span><br>
When a player raises the minimum allowed, which is two times the last bet amount.<br>

Making a bet that is larger than the size of the pot.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Three Bet (3-bet or 3b)</span><br>
Making a re-raise, which is to increase the bet after someone else raised.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Resteal</span><br>

<br>
<span class='m'>Cold Calling (cc)</span><br>
Calling a single raise when in position, or calling a 3-bet or 4-bet when you have not previously voluntarily put money in the pot. For example, MP opens to 2bb, CO 3-bets to 6bb, BN folds and SB cold calls.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Squeeze (sqz)</span><br>
3-betting after someone raised and someone else called. For example, UTG1 opens to 2bb, CO cold calls, BN squeezes to 9bb.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Continuation Bet (C-bet)</span><br>
Post-flop bet made by the player who was the last aggressor in the previous betting round.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Donk Bet or Lead Out (DK)</span><br>
When the player who is OOP bets into the aggressor on the previous betting round, denying the option to C-bet.<br>
<br>
<span class='m'>Slow Play or Trap</span><br>
