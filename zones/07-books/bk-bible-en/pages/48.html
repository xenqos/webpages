<h2>The Apocrypha</h2>

<h1>The Song of the Three Holy Children</h1>

<h3><a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span> Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span> Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span> And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span> Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span> Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span> And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span> And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span> And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span> So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span> And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span> But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span> And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span> And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span> Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span> Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span> Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span> Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above all to be praised and glorified for ever.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>50</span> O ye frost and snow, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>51</span> O ye lightnings and clouds, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>52</span> O let the earth bless the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>66</span> O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever: for he hath delivered us from hell, and saved us from the hand of death, and delivered us out of the midst of the furnace and burning flame: even out of the midst of the fire hath he delivered us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>67</span> O give thanks unto the Lord, because he is gracious: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>68</span> O all ye that worship the Lord, bless the God of gods, praise him, and give him thanks: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
