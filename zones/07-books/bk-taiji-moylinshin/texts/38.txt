** Part A: ** Place the right foot down parallel to the left (feet approximately shoulder width apart). As you shift your weight and stand up on the right leg, push up to the right with both hands, palms facing you, right hand above the left.

** Part B: ** Step with the left foot, keeping your weight on the right. As you shift your weight forward and square your hips, bring the left arm down, to the left, and up again in a big circle, making a fist as the forearm reaches its final vertical position in front of you. At the same time, bring the right forearm down in front of you, making a fist as the arm reaches its final horizontal position. (Figure 46.1)
