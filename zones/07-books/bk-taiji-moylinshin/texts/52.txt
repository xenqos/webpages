(Note: The &#8220;Fair Lady at the Shuttles&#8221; sequence (the next four moves) involves pushing in a counter-clockwise sequence into each of the four comers of an imaginary room. For explanatory purposes, these will be referred to as the North East, North West, South East, & South West comers. &#8220;North&#8221; is defined in this case as the direction one faces when one begins the Tai Chi Set. Therefore, at the end of Move #65, your left foot and hand are pointing to the West.)

** Part A: ** Bring the left arm down and to the right in a scooping motion. While turning your hips and shoulders to the right, shift your weight to the right foot, pivoting your left foot on the heel to the right until your feet are in a &#8220;pigeon-toed&#8221; position. Shift your weight back to the left foot, pivot on the ball of the right foot until the foot points East, and stand up on the right leg. At the same time, cross the arms at the wrists (shoulder height, palms inward, left hand outside). (Figure 66.1)

** Part B: ** Step with the left foot towards the North East comer. As you shift your weight onto the left foot and square the hips, turn and push both palms outward, the right arm extending straight out at shoulder height and the left arm higher and at an angle , protecting your forehead. (Figure 66.2)
