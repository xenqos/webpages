** Part A: ** Shift the weight to the right leg a and pivot the left foot on the heel 90 degrees to the right. At the same time, bring the left arm down and to the right in a scooping motion and extend the right arm at shoulder height in the same direction, pushing with the palm. As you finish reaching out to the right, bring the left hand up to the right elbow, palm up. Do not adjust your right foot. (Figure 90.1)

** Part B: ** Bring the right hand down and to the left in a scooping motion, and rotate the left palm outward in front of you in a continuous motion, also to the left. As your arms move from the right to the left in this manner, your weight shifts to the left foot and your hips and shoulders tum to face 45 degrees to the left. As you finish reaching out to the left, extend your left arm at shoulder height, pushing with the palm, and bring the right hand up to the left elbow, palm up (Figure 90.2). Move the right foot a half-step closer and parallel to the left foot.

** Part C: ** Move the arms and the weight back to the right as in Part B, this time rotating the right hand in front of you and scooping down with the left hand. (Figure 90.3)

** Part D: ** As you finish reaching out to the right, take a full sidestep to the left with the left foot (parallel to the right foot). Continue in this manner turning and reaching to the right and to the left a total of three (3) times. The third time your arms reach to the left, (Figure 90.4), move the right foot a half-step to the left, this time pointing at a 45 degree angle to the left, rather than the usual parallel position.
