** Part A: ** Open your arms and step to the left with your left foot. Shift your weight forward as you make a scooping motion with both arms in front of your knee. (Figure 37.1)

** Part B: ** Continue the scooping motion until your arms are crossed at the wrist, palms facing inward (left hand inside). Stand up on your left leg with your hands crossed in front of your chest and raise your right knee. (Figure 37.2)

** Part C: ** Extend the right leg out 45 degrees to the right in a slow kicking motion. At the same time rotate both hands away from the body, pushing the right palm in the same direction as the right foot is kicking and pushing the left palm towards the opposite direction. (Figure 37.3, and from a different view in Figure 37.4)
