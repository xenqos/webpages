# Player Actions



%[m|Raise (r)]
Increasing the price the other players have to call to enter the pot. Raising is also known as a 2-bet because the action of posting the big blind is considered as the first bet.

%[m|Check (x)]
The option to pass your turn. Pre-flop, it can only be done from the big blind if no one else raised. Post-flop, it can be done if you are first to act or if other players have checked to you.

%[m|Voluntary Put Money in the Pot (VPIP)]
When a player enters the pot by either calling or raising. Posting the blinds does not count as VPIP because the blinds are forced (not voluntary) bets.

%[m|Raise First In (RFI)]
When a player is first in and enters the pot by raising. Also referred to as open raising.

%[m|Two-bet (2-bet or 2b)]
The blinds are considered as the “First Bet”, then the first person to raise the pot is making a “Second Bet” or “Two Bet”; RFI is a special case of 2bet when there are no limpers.

%[m|Steal]
Raise First In from BN, CO or SB.

%[m|Isolate]
Raising after someone has entered the pot with the intention of playing heads-up post-flop vs that player.

%[m|Minraise]
When a player raises the minimum allowed, which is two times the last bet amount.

%[m|Minbet]
Making the minimum bet allowed. Post-flop, this is one big blind.

%[m|Overbet]
Making a bet that is larger than the size of the pot.

%[m|Three Bet (3-bet or 3b)]
Making a re-raise, which is to increase the bet after someone else raised.

%[m|Resteal]
3-betting after someone else steals.

%[m|All-in or Push]
Betting all of your chips.

%[m|Open Shove or Open Jam]
Going all-in when no one else has entered the pot before you.

%[m|3-bet-Jam, 3-bet-Shove, Reshove, or Rejam]
Moving all-in after someone else has already raised.

%[m|Four-bet (4-bet or 4b), 5-bet and any subsequent number of bets]
Refers to the number of bets that have been made during the current betting round.

%[m|Cold 4-bet]
4-betting when the player making the 4-bet was not the initial raiser. For example: UTG opens to 2bb, BN 3-bets to 5bb and the BB cold 4-bets to 12.5bb.

%[m|Cold Calling (cc)]
Calling a single raise when in position, or calling a 3-bet or 4-bet when you have not previously voluntarily put money in the pot. For example, MP opens to 2bb, CO 3-bets to 6bb, BN folds and SB cold calls.

%[m|Squeeze (sqz)]
3-betting after someone raised and someone else called. For example, UTG1 opens to 2bb, CO cold calls, BN squeezes to 9bb.

%[m|Continuation Bet (C-bet)]
Post-flop bet made by the player who was the last aggressor in the previous betting round.

%[m|Donk Bet or Lead Out (DK)]
When the player who is OOP bets into the aggressor on the previous betting round, denying the option to C-bet.

%[m|Slow Play or Trap]
To play a premium holding in a passive manner, hoping to induce a value-bet from an inferior hand or a bluff.
