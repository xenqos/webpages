# Poker Terms

%[m|Active Players]
The players involved in the hand, often referred to as the Hero and the Villain(s).

%[m|Hero]
The player from whose perspective the hand is played.

%[m|Villains]
Any of Hero’s opponents involved in the hand.

%[m|Pre-flop]
Any action that occurs before the flop is dealt.

%[m|Post-flop]
Any action that occurs after the flop has been dealt.

%[m|In Position (IP)]
The player who acts last due to their relation to the dealer/button.

%[m|Out of Position (OOP)]
The player (or players) who do not act last due to their relation to the dealer/button.

%[m|Relative Position]
A player has positional advantage over another player when he gets to act after him throughout the hand. For example, in the common situation of BB vs BN, BN gets to act last on each street for the rest of the hand, so BN is IP and conversely BB is OOP.

%[m|First In]
Refers to the situation when the action gets to a player and no other player has previously voluntary entered the pot. For example, if Hero is on the BN and everyone folds around to him, he has the option to be the first in by either calling or raising.

%[m|Stack Size and Stack Depth]
Stack depth is always displayed in terms of big blinds.
For example, if a player has 1,000,000 chips and the big blind is 100,000, he only has 10 big blinds (bb).

%[m|Effective Stack]
The smallest stack size among the active players. In a heads-up pot the effective stack size determines the maximum amount either player can lose.

%[m|Bet-size]
Bet-sizes are displayed either in big blinds (for example, Villain bets 2bb, 5bb, 25bb) or as a fraction of the pot (for example 1/3-pot, 1/2-pot, 2/3-pot).

%[m|The Nuts]
A poker hand is considered “the nuts” if it is the strongest possible hand at a specific moment. For example, AA is the nuts pre-flop. J♣T♣ is the nuts on 9<span class="red1">♥</span>8<span class="red1">♥</span>7<span class="red1">♦</span> but is no longer the nuts if the turn brings another heart, 9, 8, or 7 because stronger hands than a straight are then possible.

%[m|Effective Nuts]
A poker hand that is not the actual nuts but is strong enough that it should be played as if it were the nuts. For example, 7♣7<span class="red1">♥</span> is the effective nuts on 8<span class="red1">♥</span>7<span class="red1">♦</span>2<span class="red1">♦</span>.

%[m|Speculative Hand]
A hand that is unlikely to be best at the moment but can improve to a powerful holding later.

%[m|Air]
A hand with no showdown value or drawing potential that can only win the pot by bluffing.

%[m|Bluff Catcher]
A hand that can only beat a bluff.

%[m|Pure Bluff]
A bet or raise made with a hand that has little or no chance of improving on a later betting round with the intention of making a better hand fold on the current betting round.

%[m|Semi-Bluff]
A bet or raise made with a hand that has a decent chance of improving on a later betting round with the intention of making a better hand fold on the current betting round.

%[m|Showdown Value]
A poker hand has showdown value if, when compared to Villain’s range, it can realistically win at showdown.

%[m|Nut Advantage or Nut Threshold]
A player has the nut advantage if the effective nut hands make up a larger portion of his range than the Villain’s range.

%[m|Passive Player]
A player who tends to play his strong made hands and bluffs in a more passive manner than he should.

%[m|Aggressive Player]
A player who tends to take the betting initiative when given the opportunity.

%[m|Regular]
A player who regularly shows up in games and is assumed to play well and be experienced.

%[m|Pocket Pair]
A starting hand with two cards of the same rank. For example, A♣A<span class="red1">♦</span>, J♠J<span class="red1">♦</span>, or 5♣5<span class="red1">♥</span>.

%[m|Draw]
A player is drawing or on a draw if he has an incomplete hand and needs to improve with an additional card in order to have significant showdown value.

%[m|Gutshot or Inside Straight Draw]
A draw with four outs to make a straight.
For example, 9-7 on Q-10-6.

%[m|Open-Ended Straight Draw (OESD)]
A draw that has eight outs to make a straight. For example, J9 on QT6.

%[m|Broadway]
The nut straight, A-T.
K, Q, J, and T are referred to as broadway cards.

%[m|Any Two Cards (ATC)]
Refers to a range containing all possible holdings, often used for aggressive actions that can be taken regardless of a player’s holding.

%[m|Coin Flip / Race]
A situation where both players are all-in and both players have roughly a 50% chance to win the pot.

%[m|Cooler]
A situation when two strong hands clash and there is no way for the player with the weaker hand to fold.

%[m|Versus (vs)]
Another word for “against”. For example, Hero’s AA vs Villain’s J9.

%[m|Toy Game]
A simplified game used to model specific aspects of a real game.

%[m|Game Abstraction]
A game where there are restrictions placed on the players’ strategies intended to reduce the size and complexity of the game. The main types of abstractions are:

%[m|Information Abstraction]
A situation where some of the information states are bundled together. For example, on the flop A♣K♣Q♣, the hands 3<span class="red1">♥</span>2<span class="red1">♥</span>, 3♠2♠ and 3<span class="red1">♦</span>2<span class="red1">♦</span> can be considered as the same hand for strategic purposes.

%[m|Action Abstractions]
A situation where some of the actions in the real game are assumed to not be usable. For example, removing a player’s strategic option of calling or betting certain amounts, such as one big blind into a 100 big blind pot, or 100 big blinds into a 1 big blind pot.

%[m|Rake]
Rake is the commission fee taken by a cardroom running a poker game. Some poker rooms charge a time-based rake, so each player has to pay a fixed amount per hour that they are sitting at the table, and other cardrooms charge rake as a percentage of the pot, usually 2.5% to 10% of the pot, depending on the game. There is usually a cap to the amount of money the casino takes from each pot. For example, in a poker game with 5% rake capped at $5, the maximum amount the house can take from the pot will be $5 from any pot that is $100 or larger. Most poker rooms also have the rule that rake is only taken if a flop is dealt, so any action that finishes without a flop being dealt will not be subject to rake. For example, if MP raises to 2.5bb, BN 3-bets to 8bb, MP 4-bets to 24bb and everyone else folds, the house won’t take any money from the pot because the flop wasn’t dealt, regardless of how much money went into the pot.

%[m|Calling Station]
A player who never folds a made hand regardless of the action.
