<a name='name.839'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Table Stakes</h2>
<p>A rule in a poker game meaning that a player may not go into his pocket for money during a hand. He may only invest the amount of money in front of him into the current pot. If he runs out of chips during the hand, a side pot is created in which he has no interest. All casino poker is played as table stakes. </p>
<p>The definition sometimes also includes the rule that a player may not remove chips from the table during a game. While this rule might not be referred to as &quot;table stakes,&quot; it is enforced almost universally in public poker games.</p>

<a name='name.840'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Tag</h2>
<p>&#039;TAG&#039; in poker stands for &#039;Tight Aggressive&#039;, a style of play that involves playing fewer hands (tight) but betting and raising aggressively with those hands. This style is often recommended for beginners due to its balance of caution and assertiveness.</p>
<h3>What is TAG in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;TAG&#039; stands for &#039;Tight Aggressive&#039;, which is a style of play that is both selective about the starting hands (tight) and assertive in betting and raising with those hands (aggressive). This approach is often seen as a balanced style of play, which makes it a popular choice, especially among beginners.</p>
<h3>Understanding TAG Style </h3>
<p>A player adopting a TAG style will play fewer hands compared to loose players, but when they do play, they tend to bet and raise aggressively. This style is often effective because it allows players to avoid tricky situations with marginal hands, while maximizing value from strong hands.</p>
<p>The tight aspect of TAG means that a player is selective about the hands they play, often choosing only strong starting hands. The aggressive aspect means that when a player does decide to play a hand, they play it assertively, often betting and raising to put pressure on their opponents.</p>
<h3>Using TAG Style in Your Strategy </h3>
<p>Adopting a TAG style can be beneficial for several reasons. It can help you to avoid difficult decisions post-flop because you&#039;re more likely to be playing with strong hands. It can also allow you to build large pots when you have a strong hand, and to often take down pots without a showdown due to your aggressive betting.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;TAG Style&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt a high pair like KK, a TAG player would likely raise or even re-raise pre-flop to thin the field and build the pot.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He adopted a TAG style, playing fewer hands but betting aggressively when he did play.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Her TAG style often allowed her to take down pots without a showdown.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Using a TAG style, he was able to avoid tricky post-flop decisions by playing mostly strong starting hands.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.846'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Texture</h2>
<p>The &#039;Texture&#039; in poker refers to the arrangement or the state of the community cards dealt on the table.</p>
<h3>What is Texture in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Texture&#039; refers to the description of how the community cards (flop, turn, and river) look and feel in terms of connectivity, suits, and ranks. The texture of the board can range from &quot;dry&quot; (unconnected and unsuited cards) to &quot;wet&quot; (connected and suited cards).</p>
<h3>Understanding Texture </h3>
<p>The texture of the board can significantly influence the action in a hand of poker. It can affect the potential hand combinations, the strength of a player&#039;s hand, and the betting strategy.</p>
<h3>Reading the Texture </h3>
<p>Recognizing the texture of the board is a critical skill in poker. It can help predict what hands are possible, how likely they are, and how to respond to bets and raises.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Texture&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, a flop of 2-7-King of different suits is considered a &quot;dry&quot; texture, while a flop of 8-9-10 of the same suit represents a &quot;wet&quot; texture.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He analyzed the texture of the board before deciding to bet.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The wet texture of the flop made her cautious to bet too heavily.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite the dry texture of the board, he decided to bluff.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.851'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Three-Bet</h2>
<p>Commonly used to refer to an initial reraise before the flop. The term has its origins in fixed-limit games where an initial raise is worth two bets, then the reraise is equal to three and so on.

<p>After that, the next reraise is called a “four-bet” and so on.  Thus when someone is described as “five-bet shoving all in,” it is understood that the all-in raise came following a series of raises back and forth.</p>

<p>A &#039;Tournament&#039; in poker is a competition where players compete against each other until one player has all the chips.</p>
<h3>What is a Tournament in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Tournament&#039; is a structured competition where players compete against each other with the goal of accumulating all the chips. Players buy in for the same amount and are given a set amount of chips. As players are eliminated, the remaining players are re-seated until only one player has all the chips.</p>
<h3>Understanding a Tournament </h3>
<p>Tournaments can vary in size from just two players (a &quot;heads-up&quot; tournament) to thousands of players for large online events. They also vary in terms of structure, including the speed at which blinds and antes increase, and whether players can re-buy or add-on.</p>
<h3>Types of Tournaments </h3>
<p>There are various types of poker tournaments, including freezeouts (no re-buys), rebuys (players can buy more chips), shootouts (players must win their table before advancing), and satellites (the prize is entry into a larger tournament).</p>
<h3>Example of a &quot;Tournament&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event is a well-known poker tournament that attracts players from all over the world.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He entered a poker tournament at the local casino and ended up finishing in third place.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She won a satellite tournament to gain entry into a larger, more prestigious tournament.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The tournament had over 200 entrants, making for a large prize pool.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.875'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Trips</h2>
<p>&#039;Trips&#039; in poker refers to having three of a kind, specifically when two of those three cards are not in your hand, but on the board.</p>
<h3>What are Trips in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, &#039;Trips&#039; or a &#039;Set&#039; refers to having three of a kind. However, &#039;Trips&#039; specifically refers to a situation where two of the three matching cards are on the board (community cards), and one is in your hand.</p>
<h3>Understanding Trips </h3>
<p>Trips is a strong hand in poker but is ranked below a straight and above two pair. It&#039;s worth noting that trips and a set are different. A set refers to three of a kind where two of the three matching cards are in your hand, and one is on the board.</p>
<h3>Playing Trips </h3>
<p>When you have trips, you have a strong hand that could potentially win the pot at showdown. However, it&#039;s important to consider other players&#039; actions and potential better hands they may have.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Trips&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player holds an Ace and a King, and the board shows Ace-Ace-Queen-7-2, the player has trips.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He made trips on the flop but decided to slow play to not scare off his opponents.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She lost the pot despite having trips, as her opponent had a flush.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Even though he had trips, he decided to fold due to the potential straight on the board.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.877'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Turbo</h2>
<p>A Turbo in poker refers to a type of tournament in which the blind levels increase much faster than in a standard tournament, leading to quicker rounds and faster overall gameplay.</p>
<h3>What is a Turbo? </h3>
<p>In poker, <b>Turbo</b> refers to a type of tournament where the blind levels increase at a faster rate compared to standard tournaments. This leads to shorter rounds, quicker tournament progression, and faster overall gameplay. Turbo tournaments require players to make decisions more quickly and adapt to rapidly changing betting environments.</p>
<h3>Playing in Turbo Tournaments </h3>
<p>Playing in <b>Turbo</b> tournaments requires a different strategy compared to standard tournaments. Due to the faster pace, players need to be more aggressive and willing to take calculated risks. Passive play is generally not as effective in Turbo tournaments, as the blinds increase quickly and can deplete a player&#039;s stack if they&#039;re not actively winning pots.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Playing Turbo Tournaments </h3>
<p>When playing Turbo tournaments, it&#039;s important to consider factors such as stack size, blind levels, and player tendencies. With the blinds increasing rapidly, maintaining a healthy chip stack becomes crucial. It&#039;s also important to adjust your play to the faster pace and higher variance of Turbo tournaments.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Turbo&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, in a Turbo tournament, the blinds might increase every 5 minutes, compared to 15 minutes in a standard tournament. This means that players will have less time to wait for premium hands and will need to be more aggressive.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to enter the Turbo tournament because he only had a couple of hours to play.&quot;</li><li>&quot;In the Turbo tournament, her aggressive strategy helped her quickly build a large chip stack.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Turbo tournaments can be a fun and fast-paced alternative to standard poker tournaments.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>Trips is a strong hand in poker but is ranked below a straight and above two pair. It&#039;s worth noting that trips and a set are different. A set refers to three of a kind where two of the three matching cards are in your hand, and one is on the board.</p>
<h3>Playing Trips </h3>
<p>When you have trips, you have a strong hand that could potentially win the pot at showdown. However, it&#039;s important to consider other players&#039; actions and potential better hands they may have.</p>

<ul><li>

[] &quot;She lost the pot despite having trips, as her opponent had a flush.&quot;</p></li><li>&quot;Even though he had trips, he decided to fold due to the potential straight on the board.&quot;</li></ul>
