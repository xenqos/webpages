<a name='name.915'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Walk</h2>
<p>A &#039;Walk&#039; in poker refers to a situation where all players fold to the big blind.</p>
<h3>What is a Walk in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Walk&#039; is a situation where all players fold to the big blind in a hand. When this happens, the big blind wins the pot without having to see a flop or make any further bets.</p>
<h3>Understanding Walks </h3>
<p>Walks are more common in tournament play where blinds and antes represent a significant portion of a player&#039;s stack. They can be a welcome relief for the big blind, who gets to increase their chip stack without any risk.</p>
<h3>Impact of a Walk </h3>
<p>A walk can have various impacts on the game. For the big blind, it&#039;s an opportunity to win chips without any contest. For the other players, it&#039;s a missed opportunity to win the pot. It can also affect the game&#039;s pace and dynamic, particularly in a tournament setting.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Walk&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if all players fold to the big blind, the big blind will get a walk.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He got a walk and won the pot without having to see a flop.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She was hoping for a walk to increase her chip stack without any risk.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a strong hand, he decided to fold, giving his opponent a walk.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.916'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Walk the Table</h2>
<p>The automatic winning of the entire pot with a certain specific card or hand.</p>

<p>Coiling or crimping cards by a cheater so the wavy card can be spotted in an opponent's hand or in the deck.</p>

<a name='name.920'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Wayne Gretzky</h2>
<p>A nickname for <q class='x'>9</q><q class='x'>9</q>. After the legendary hockey player's jersey number (99).</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.921'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Weak</h2>
<p>One who folds too many hands. </p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.922'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Weak Ace</h2>
<p>A &#039;Weak Ace&#039; in poker refers to a starting hand where a player has an Ace with a low-value kicker. These hands can be tricky to play, as the Ace makes them potentially strong, but the weak kicker can often lead to losing situations.</p>
<h3>What is a Weak Ace in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Weak Ace&#039; refers to a starting hand where a player has an Ace paired with a low-value kicker (the second card in a player&#039;s hand). While the presence of an Ace makes these hands seem strong, the low kicker can often put players in difficult situations.</p>
<h3>Understanding Weak Aces </h3>
<p>Weak Aces can be challenging hands to play in poker. While the Ace is the highest value card in the deck, having a weak kicker can lead to tricky situations, especially if another player also has an Ace with a higher kicker.</p>
<p>Playing a Weak Ace can often lead to &#039;domination&#039;, a situation where a player&#039;s hand is inferior to another player&#039;s hand. For example, if you&#039;re holding A4 (a Weak Ace) and another player holds AQ (a stronger Ace), you are &#039;dominated&#039; because unless you hit a four on the board to make two pair or trips, you will lose the hand.</p>
<h3>Playing with Weak Aces </h3>
<p>When playing with Weak Aces, caution is advised. As a general rule, these hands should be played conservatively, especially in early position or against a raise. However, in later position or in certain circumstances, it might be profitable to play these hands more aggressively.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Weak Ace&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and you&#039;re dealt A3, you have a Weak Ace. The Ace could potentially make a top pair, but the 3 kicker is likely to be out-kicked by other players holding an Ace with a higher second card.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He decided to fold his Weak Ace in early position, avoiding a potentially tricky post-flop situation.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Holding a Weak Ace, she decided to play cautiously, aware of the risk of being dominated by a stronger Ace.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a Weak Ace, he decided to raise in late position, hoping to steal the blinds.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.926'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Wet Board</h2>
<p>A reference to the “texture” of the community cards in hold’em or Omaha. A “wet board” refers to one in which the community cards are suited or connected in ways that provide many possibilities to make straights or flushes, or to provide draws for either or both. For example, a board of

<q class='c'>T</q>
<q class='h'>9</q>
<q class='c'>8</q>

would be considered “wet.” (See also “Dry Board.”)</p>

<a name='name.927'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Whale</h2>
<p>A Whale in poker refers to a player who often bets large amounts and typically plays hands loosely. These players are usually less skilled and can potentially lose big sums of money.</p>
<h3>What is a Whale? </h3>
<p>In poker, a <b>Whale</b> is a term used to describe a player who often bets large amounts and tends to play hands loosely. These players are usually less skilled and are known for potentially losing big sums of money. Whales are often sought after in poker games, as they can significantly contribute to the pot and other players can benefit from their loose and often reckless play.</p>
<h3>Playing Against Whales </h3>
<p>Playing against <b>Whales</b> can be profitable due to their loose playing style and tendency to make large bets. However, it&#039;s important to play carefully as their large bets can also pose a risk. Patience and strategic play are key when playing against Whales.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Playing Against Whales </h3>
<p>When playing against Whales, it&#039;s important to consider their playing style and adjust your strategy accordingly. They often play many hands and make large bets, so patience, disciplined play, and a good understanding of poker strategy can be beneficial.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Whale&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, a player who consistently makes large bets and plays many hands, regardless of their strength, can be considered a Whale. Other players at the table might aim to play hands against this player in hopes of winning large pots.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;The Whale at the table was playing almost every hand and making large bets, regardless of the strength of his cards.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She managed to win a large pot after the Whale at the table made a big bet with a weak hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Having a Whale at your poker table can make the game more interesting and potentially more profitable.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.929'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Wheel</h2>
<p>A &#039;Wheel&#039; in poker refers to the lowest straight possible, which is A-2-3-4-5. It&#039;s also known as the &#039;bicycle&#039; or &#039;bike&#039;, and is a powerful hand as it can also qualify as a low, depending on the game variant.</p>
<h3>What is a Wheel in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Wheel&#039; refers to a straight that runs from Ace through 5: A-2-3-4-5. Also known as the &#039;bicycle&#039; or &#039;bike&#039;, it is the lowest straight possible. Despite being the &#039;lowest&#039; straight, the Wheel is a strong hand because it can also qualify as a low, depending on the game variant.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Wheel </h3>
<p>The Wheel is a unique hand in poker as it involves the Ace which typically acts as the highest card in the deck, but in this case, it&#039;s used as a low card. It&#039;s also a powerful hand in games like Omaha Hi-Lo or Stud Hi-Lo, where the goal is to make the lowest hand possible. The Wheel, in these games, is often the best possible &#039;low&#039; hand you can make.</p>
<h3>Playing with a Wheel </h3>
<p>When playing with a Wheel, it&#039;s important to consider the game variant and the tendencies of your opponents. In games where low hands are favored, a Wheel can be incredibly powerful. However, in games where only the high hand wins, a Wheel is still a straight, but it&#039;s the lowest one.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Wheel&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if you&#039;re playing a hand of Texas Hold&#039;em and the community cards are A-2-4-5-J, and you hold a 3 in your hand, you have a Wheel.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He managed to complete his Wheel on the river, giving him the best low hand.&quot;</li><li>&quot;She was excited to see the 5 on the turn, completing her Wheel.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite only being the lowest straight, his Wheel was enough to win the pot.&quot;</li></ul>

<a name='name.956'>&nbsp;</a><h2>wrap</h2>
<p>A &#039;Wrap&#039; in poker refers to a straight draw where there are 13 or more cards that can complete the straight.</p>
<h3>What is a Wrap in Poker? </h3>
<p>In poker, a &#039;Wrap&#039; is a term used in Omaha poker to describe a straight draw where there are 13 or more cards that can complete the straight. It is a more powerful version of an open-ended straight draw or a double gutshot.</p>
<h3>Understanding Wraps </h3>
<p>In Omaha poker, players receive four hole cards instead of two, which leads to a larger number of potential combinations and makes wraps possible. A wrap can have up to 20 outs, which makes it a very strong drawing hand.</p>
<h3>Playing a Wrap </h3>
<p>When you have a wrap, you have a strong drawing hand that could potentially become a straight. However, even though a wrap is a strong draw, it&#039;s important to remember that it&#039;s still just a draw and not a made hand.</p>
<h3>Example of &quot;Wrap&quot; </h3>
<p>For instance, if a player holds A-K-Q-J and the board shows 10-9-2, the player has a wrap. Any 7, 8, Jack, Queen, or King will complete the straight.</p>
<ul><li>&quot;He was hoping to hit one of his many outs on the turn to complete his wrap.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Despite having a wrap, she decided to fold due to the large bet from her opponent.&quot;</li><li>&quot;With four cards to a straight, he had a wrap and several ways to complete his hand.&quot;</li></ul>

<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#top'><span class='clNavTop'><span></a></p>


<a name='name.957'>&nbsp;</a><h2>Wraparound</h2>
<p>In Omaha, a situation in which your four downcards consist of three consecutive cards, which combine with two cards of the flop to form five consecutive cards, so that a large number of cards on the turn or river give you a straight. For example, your downcards are 6-5-4-A, and the flop is 7-8-K. You can make a straight with any of 13 cards, any 6, 5, or 4, three each of which remain, or any 9, of which four remain. Compare with full wrap and inside wrap.</p>
