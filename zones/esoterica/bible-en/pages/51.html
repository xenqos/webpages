<h2>The Apocrypha</h2>

<h1>The Prayer of Manasses King of Juda</h1>

<i>when he was holden captive in Babylon</i><br>

<h3><a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span> O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span> who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span> who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span> whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span> for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is importable:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span> but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span> for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span> Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span> for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span> I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have any release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span> Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span> I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span> wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquities. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span> and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span> Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
