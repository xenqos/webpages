** Part A: ** Take a half-step forward with your right foot placing it flat on the floor at a 45 degree angle. (Figure 28.1)

** Part B: ** Stand up and shift your weight onto the right foot raising your left heel off the floor. Pull the right hand back and to the side as you push away at shoulder height with the left hand. Bend forward from the waist, reaching toward the floor with your right hand and bringing your left hand in. (Figure 28.2)
As you continue to reach down, encircle your right arm near the wrist with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand. (Figure 28.3) Stand straight up, facing the right comer, with the weight still on the right leg. The palms face each other at shoulder height.
