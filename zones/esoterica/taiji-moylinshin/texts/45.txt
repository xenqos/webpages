** Part A: ** Open your fist and tum the palm up. While shifting your weight onto your right foot, raise your left hand palm up under your right elbow. Draw your right arm back and your left arm forward, as if brushing off your right forearm. Turn your hips to 45 degrees and separate your hands to shoulder width. (Figure 54.1)

** Part B: ** Push straight forward with both arms, turning your palms forward while shifting your weight to your left foot and squaring your hips. (Figure 54.2)
