For example, if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates increase by 1%, the bond's price will decline by approximately 5%. Conversely, if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates fall by 1%, the bond's price will increase by approximately 5%.


Understanding duration is particularly important for those who are planning on selling their bonds prior to maturity. If you purchase a 10-year bond that yields 4% for \$1,000, you will still receive \$40 dollars each year and will get back your \$1,000 principal after 10 years regardless of what happens with interest rates. If, however, you sell that bond before maturity (or if you are invested in a fund that buys and sells bonds while you own it) then the price of your bonds will be affected by changes in rates.

If, for example, you expect rates to rise, it may make sense to focus on shorter-duration investments (in other words, those that have less interest-rate risk).

It is a measurement of how long, in years, it takes for the price of a bond to be repaid by its internal cash flows. It is an important measure for investors to consider, as bonds with higher durations carry more risk and have higher price volatility than bonds with lower durations.
