If you ignore fundamental analysis, you could be surprised by news events.

If you ignore technical analysis, you could be affected by price movements at key levels!

If you completely ignore sentiment analysis and go with your own gut instead, you could be entering a trade in the completely wrong, illogical direction.

You won’t be taking into account the mood of the larger trading community. You need to be tuned in as to what the general opinion is of events. It will impact price, so it can’t just be ignored.

Of course, another part of fundamental analysis is knowing that when there’s big news coming out that covers a country’s political situation, it’s best to stay out of the market!

Many traders, including myself, did not trade GBP during that time. It was simply too risky because no one can predict what the forex market is actually going to do in a situation like that.
