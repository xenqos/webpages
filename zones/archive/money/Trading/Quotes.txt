Mike McDermott: Listen, here's the thing. If you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker.

Mike McDermott: Guys around here will tell ya, you play for a living, it's like any other job. You don't gamble, you grind it out.
Your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it. Get your money in when you have the best of it. Protect it when you don't. Don't give anything away.

Mike McDermott: That's how I paid my way through half of law school. A true grinder. You see, I learned how to win a little at a time. But finally I've learned this: if you're too careful, your whole life can become a fuckin' grind.

Mike McDermott: I took a risk, I took a risk, you see all the angles, and you never have the fucking stones to play one

Joey Knish: Stones? you little punk, I'm not playing for the thrill of fucking victory here, I owe rent, alimony, child support, I play for money, my kids eat, I got stones enough not to chase card actions of fucking pipe dreams of winning the world series on ESPN, but about the money I've got to turn my back, I've got to say no.

Jo: You always told me this was the rule. Rule number one: Throw away your cards the moment you know they can't win. Fold the fucking hand.
