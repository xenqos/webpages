The major players in the spot market control the majority of the market and simply accumulate and distribute currencies to investors, retailers and other market participants.

Regardless of what the news says, their inventories of a currency and where price is currently   trading will dictate how they act.

The big money players will always be selling into strength and buying into weakness.

90% of retailers will be doing the exact opposite - buying into strength and selling into weakness; exactly what the smart money needs to happen.

This is why a high-impact news event may seem to be bullish for a currency pair, but shortly after a bullish spike price quickly retreats and actually sells off hard.

This is the major banks selling into strength. They need retailers to be fearful and sell and to be greedy and buy. These two emotions dictate everything.
