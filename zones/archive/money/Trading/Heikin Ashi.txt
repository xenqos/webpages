HA_Open = ( HA_Open[-1] + HA_Close[-1] ) / 2
HA_Close = ( Open[0] + High[0] + Low[0] + Close[0] ) / 4
HA_High = Max( High[0], HA_Open[0], HA_Close[0] )
HA_Low = Min( Low[0], HA_Open[0], HA_Close[0] )

## Interpretation

[-
Based on two period averages.
Traditional candlestick patterns are not applicable.
The absence of a shadow also reflects strength.
Long upper and lower shadows show indecision.
Doji and spinning tops indicate indecision.
Classic chart patterns and trend lines can be used.
